%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
seem to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It feels
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
# Assumes Itlachiayaque (smooth shield)
%Cc Arc 00082
%l looks over %os polished surface.

"Of all the items that have been excavated from %i,
this one has given us the greatest insight into Toltec civilisation.
Understand that guarding this artifact is no small responsibility,
%p. Now, it is time that you resumed your expedition for the
Amulet. %Z await you through the portal which brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the Astral Plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."

Suddenly, you find yourself back in the warrens surrounding the Last Bastion.
%E
%Cp Ana 00002
Once again, you return to the Last Bastion.
%E
%Cp Ana 00003
You are back at the Last Bastion.

You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Ana 00005
"The sepulchers have opened!  The Seraphs are rising to the surface!"
%E
%Cp Ana 00006
"They know our location.  This position will be overrun shortly."
%E
%Cp Ana 00007
"We're out of time."
%E
%Cp Ana 00008
"Ever since the Rapture of Slime, the puppets of the Black Web have been appearing on the surface in great numbers."
%E
%Cp Ana 00009
"You must speak with Sara before the Last Bastion falls!"
%E
%Cp Ana 00010
"Have you seen the flowers at the end of time?"

%Cp Ana 00011
"We're being overrun!"

%Cp Ana 00013

%E
%Cp Ana 00014
"You retrieved the Annulus?  Why?  It won't save us now."
%E
%Cc Ana 00015
"I'm glad you were able to return.  For you, many days have
gone by since you were sent back, but for us, it's only been
a few minutes.

"The mission to the past was meant to be a one-way trip.
However, our Enemy's attack has forced us to send you 
back prematurely, and to recall you from farther down
the time-stream, in the hopes that you can complete the
final preparations for your mission.

"But, before I can tell you in more detail what you
must do, I must check to see if you have grown strong
enough to withstand the perils ahead."
%E
%Cp Ana 00016
"You have returned from farther down the time-stream, I see.
Let me check if you are strong enough now."
%E
%Cp Ana 00017
"You have traveled quite far down the time-stream now.
Let me check if you are strong enough now."
%E
%Cc Ana 00018
"%p, my %s!  How could you betray us!

"Begone!  Live out what remains of your cursed life in
the doomed, distant past!"
%E
%Cc Ana 00019
"%sC, you are not yet strong enough to undertake the mission
I must give you now.  The army of the bastions has tried, 
and failed, to complete this mission for our entire lives.

Go now, return to the past, and come back to us from farther down
the time-stream."
%E
%Cc Ana 00020
"%sC, I fear that you have strayed from your chosen path.

"The Enemy will exploit any weaknesses in your psyche.  Return
to the past and rededicate yourself to the %a path."
%E
%Cc Ana 00021
"%sC, you may now be ready to undertake the final preparations
for your mission.

"The great Enemy, the Grey Thought Entity called Ilsensine, comes to
Yggdrasil from the Far Realms that lie beyond it.  She entered our
world in the distant past, possibly even through the beginning.  For
eons, she lay dormant as the seed of inspiration, burried in the 
minds of the gods of Law.

"In this age before ages, the mind flayers ruled the universe, having
themselves traveled through far realms to that era from the distant
future.  They learned of that nascent thought, or brought knowledge
of it back from the future, and worshiped it as Ilsensine.

"Before the mind flayers could complete preparations for the rise of
the Enemy, they were overthrown by a revolt of the slave races, and
the great ring of Penumbra was broken.

"But the gods of Law, contemplating the strange natural order of
the mind flayers, stumbled on the Thought, and were consumed by
it.  The other gods of the heavens became aware of the Enemy and
fought against it, but they too were consumed one by one, until only
the gods of the earth remained.

"The mortal races of the earth were trapped between the new God
of the heavens and the old gods of earth.  But they were not
unprepared.

"Our ancestors discovered a silver bell that could open anything.
They turned the power of this bell against itself, opening a ring-
shaped hole in the world through which the foreign Thought Entity
could be ejected from the universe.

"The greatest hero of the age wielded this Annulus in battle
with the servants of Ilsensine, on the day of our birth when the
heavens fell to earth.  The Annulus was lost at Ground Zero in 
the defeat at the Battle of Heavenfall and the Night of Falling
Stars.

"It is too late to employ the Annulus against Ilsensine, for all
the base matter of the world now stirs with her thoughts.  The only
hope is to take the Annulus back into the past, to before Ilsensine
overran the heavens, and employ it against her then.  This is the
great mission for which you have spent your whole life training.

"However, the Annulus remains lost at Ground Zero.  All the 
armies of the Resistance have been unable to penetrate deep 
enough into enemy teritory to reach that place, and now there
are no armies left.  We have no choice but to send you, the Last
Hero of this or any age to come, alone in the hopes that you can
succeed where they failed.  Should you do so, you must return to
me so that I can tell you of the final stage of the plan."
%E
%Cp Ana 00025
"We are the final generation, born the day the heavens fell.  No more
will be born after us, unless you can change the course of history."
%E
%Cp Ana 00026
"The night of falling stars ended coordinated resistance on the
surface.  Only a few underground bastions survived the night."
%E
%Cp Ana 00027
"Should you meet a Dread Seraph, I can only suggest you run."
%E
%Cp Ana 00028
"You should make liberal use of magic maps and object detection."
%E
%Cp Ana 00029
"The Black Flowers are dangerous for their song, not their combat
prowess."
%E
%Cp Ana 00030
"Intoners are fast, seductive warriors, who sing many songs and
cast many spells.  I can only advise you to kill them quickly
from a distance."
%E
%Cp Ana 00031
"Beware the Army of Neverweres, or they will steal your
equipment and your blood."
%E
%Cp Ana 00032
"The remaining Troopers of the Last Bastion will hold the
line as long as they are able."
%E
%Cp Ana 00033
"Those Changed by exposure to the Far Realms of Insanity
require isolation suits to exist in our atmosphere.  If
the suit is breached, the Changed inside will eventually
boil away into poison mist."
%E
%Cp Ana 00034
"I hope you found luck in the past, for there is surely
none left in this fading world."
%E
%Cc Ana 00035
You have reached the ruins of a great city, destroyed in
the rain of falling stars that came after the great defeat
at the Battle of Heavenfall.  Beyond the city you see the
ever-expanding Penumbral zone rising into the night sky.

You will have to pass through the city and the nascent 
Penumbra if you are to reach Ground Zero, where the Annulus
was lost on the Eve of Falling Stars, on the day of your
birth.
%i.
%E
%Cp Ana 00036
Once again, you arrive at the ruins of the city.

Sara, the Last Oracle, looks wonderingly at the
Annulus.

"Well done, %s.  You have succeed where
all others have failed, and returned hope to
our world.

"You must now travel deep into the earth, and
retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, that was stolen by
Moloch at the beginning of time.

"With the Amulet in your possetion, the gods will
allow you to climb up to the Astral Plane.  Once
there, you must use the Annulus to Annul the High
Altar of Ilsensine and eject her from this
universe."
%E
%Cc Ana 00082
"The Annulus is the pinnacle of mortal technology, created
by turning the power of the Bell of Opening upon itself,
creating a door through the universe through which even

"You must not loose it or fail to take it with you to
the Astral Plane, or all our struggles will have been
for naught."

%Cc Ana 00091
"You've done it!  But there is still nothing you can do for us
now.  Go back to the past, and bear the Amulet of Yendor up

to Annul the High Altar of Ilsensine and eject her from
this universe before she can consume the heavens and the
earth."

Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can %x the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, should %l be there?

Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
evil magic in the air.

Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:

    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
%E
%Cp Bar 00002

"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain

me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"

"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about him.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

%n, defeat him, and return %o to us.  Only
then will the world be safe."

Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.

The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the

Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.

"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly

of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."

Suddenly, you see yourself at the surroundings of %H.
You smile as you recognize the land, remembering of the days you lived here,
learning the power of songs over nature, before you went on your voyages 
around the world.

But, wait... something is wrong.  The land looks desolated; the beautiful
river, which flow produced a soft music, now looks dead; the breeze,
once an inspiration to the music students, makes you shiver. The nymphs are
scattered and it seems all the muses abandoned the place. You feel something 
is wrong with the wild life here, too.  What happened to %H?
%E
%Cp Brd 00002
By %d, you can't bear seeing %H again in this sorry state!  You must hurry.

You see %l smile sadly as you approaches him.

"%pC, it has been a long time since you departed.  I hope you had made
good use of your musical abilities in your voyages, since you was my most
promising student.  But I did not called you to discuss that.

"%HC are in desperate need of your help, and you are to 
go on the most difficult task of your life. But first, let me hear your

%E
%Cp Brd 00016
"Well, %p, one more time you returns to %H.
Perhaps you are now ready..."
%E
%Cp Brd 00017
"%pC, we do not have time for purposeless talking. Anyone who studies the
mysteries of music must understand that music is not supposed to
be only an entertainment. You were called for a very dangerous quest,
but you can only take it after you are really prepared!"
%E
%Cc Brd 00018
"You are not honoring your training, %p!

"You are expulsed from %H. Go away! I need to find
another one."
%E
%Cc Brd 00019
"%pC, you have not yet mastered your full potential to harmonize your

for you will demand at least %Ra. Go, now, train yourself in
the arts you learned here, and return when you become more experienced."
%E
%Cc Brd 00020
"What is that, %p? You had deviated from the paths of %d?

"Remember what I taught you: music is a gift from the gods.
If you can not harmonize yourself with %d, you will not be able
to harmonize your music with any living creature.

"Go for now, %p. Learn the %a paths again, and only return when
you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Brd 00021
"%p, I see you are ready for this dire task.

"%HC was attacked by dozens of wild animals controlled by the

and %o was taken. 
She always envied the power %o has over nature and all 
living things. 

"%pC, I am too old and weak to go after %o.  You was
always my most promising student; it is over your shoulders the responsibility
of rescuing it.

"Please, take %o back from %n.  We do not know what
she can do with it, and it is supposed to be used to create harmony in this
world, not as an instrument to enslave nature.  You must travel to

The aura of %o tingles at the edge of your perception.
%E
%Cc Brd 00050
%nC holds %o close to her face, and she seems to be
quietly talking to it. After hearing you enter, she looks at you and her
cold stare makes you paralyzed for a second; then her beautiful, frightening
voice is heard:

"%lC sent one of his pupils instead of coming himself? 

"Mortal hands do not deserve to touch %o, its power is beyond 
your understanding. I can use its melodies to control all beings, maybe even 
nature itself... I know I can. It should always have been mine. I deserve it!"

%Cc Brd 00051
"You again, %p?  You are not able to handle %o... how could

"I shall make %H the palace of my empire over nature!

"Are you ready yet to beg for mercy?  I could be lenient..."
%E
%Cp Brd 00064
"You shall join the enslaved multitude I command!"

"Your soul belongs to me now, %p! Grovel before your queen!"

As you touch %o, its harmonic power infuses you with joy.
You finally understand what %l always meant when he talked about
harmonizing with the living beings throughout the music.  Although you feel in

its rightful owner, %l.
%E
%Cc Brd 00080
%nC yells while her legs falter and she falls to the floor:

    Do not be shy, my %S; it is yours know. May %d give you wisdom
    on how to use it.

"Congratulations, %p.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.

"Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
the Amulet on the altar of %d.  Along the way you shall pass through the

Suddenly, you stand before the ruins of an ancient building. All 
around you, shadows flit and flicker below an indistinct sky. A
cold breeze blows in aimless breaths, bearing the rumor of distant
whispers.

You know this place well; though you have been here but once before,
and that in a dream. That night, as you stood over the strange, dry
corpse that sprawls alone within the shell of this ruined library,
the wind whispered to you with a thousand tounges, speaking the 
names that still ring in your ears, the names that drove you
into exile.

You do not dream now. The wind is filled with a muted tension, 
as of a scream just bellow the threshold of hearing, and dark
creatures stalk the wastes around %H.

%E
%Cc Bin 00020
You feel that you have left your path, and must return to the %a.
%E
%Cc Bin 00021
You reach out as well, and together you bridge the distance.

A bloody form now hangs before you, a form that may once have been
a man, now savaged by great beasts. So violent was the attack that
the beasts' teeth were torn from their sockets, and lodged in the
man's skin. The shear variety of teeth bears mute witness to the
number of assailants that dogged the man.

The thousand whisperers speak as one: "Dahlver-Nar; Dahlver of the
teeth; the first to listen, the first to speak. Dahlver-Nar, of
the Gates of Teeth, who built the way through which we reach."

The bloody form moans in pain and paws at it's ruined, 
toothless mouth with its ruined, tooth-torn hands.

"Another now seeks to close those Gates. A mortal man, who died
and yet walked on, who moulderd to dust, and yet thought on.
Acererak the Devourer, Acererak the skull; who lives and stands
and thinks now on both sides of the Gates, who has but to bite
down, to cut off the breeze through which we talk, to sever 
the way on which you walk."

This place, too, you know well, for it is the village of your waking

In your youth, the world was a simple place. You could see your whole
life, mapped out in the lives of your ancestors. You knew the one 
that you would wed, the church where you would marry, the land that 
you would work, and the place that you would lay until the world
was remade.

But all that was swept away in a single night, by the dream that
led to your exile.

Some strange magic is at work, for your village is not located near
the Lost Library. At least, you don't think it is, you never were
a traveler. You resolve to pass quickly through the village. You 
know of a passage to the woods outside town, through the church
catacombs.

%E
%Cc Dna 00021
"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,

"There were lots of dragons in the North in the old days, and
gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves 
flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse.  There
was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug.
One day he flew up into the air and came south.

"Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside - well, from a
good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout
of flame.  The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there
was the dragon waiting for them.  None escaped that way.  Then he
crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and
lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After
that there were no more dwarves left alive inside, and he took 
all their wealth for himself.  Probably has piled it all up in a
great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed.

"The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and
cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father
and grandfather with singed beards.

"I had often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's
escape, but then I was given a map and a key by Gandalf the Grey,
and now I see that they had a private Side-door which only they 
knew about.  And now we mean to get back our stolen treasure,
and bring our curses home to Smaug - if we can.

"I'm still unclear how you came to be here, but if you will help
us, and avenge your people, you have my blessing.  The key is in
this sack here."
%E
%Cp Dna 00025
"Smaug blocked up the front gate long ago."

mountain, and the gate is ruined and collapsed.  You recall
the side entrance mentioned by Thorin, and feel for the key
in your pack.

Once again, you stand before the Front Gate.

"It is now many years ago that a shadow of disquiet fell upon
our people. Words began to be whispered in secret: it was
said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater
wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some
spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called
in our own tongue Khazad-dum; and they declared that now at last
we had the power and numbers to return.

"Moria! Moria! Wonder of the northern world! Too deep we delved
there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions 
lain empty since the children of Durin fled. At last, however,
Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though
I did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Oin and
many of our folk, and they went away south.

"For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages reported 
that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there. Then
there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria since.

"It falls to you to travel south to the gates of Moria, to find
what has become of Balin and our people. The forces of the Enemy
are gathering on our eastern borders, and war grows near. Should
we be attacked unlooked for out of the south, by orcs marching
in force from Moria, it would go ill for us indeed."

You find that the Gate-stream has been dammed, turning the 
shallow  valley before the Walls of Moria into a dark still 
lake. Neither sky nor sun is reflected on its sullen 
surface.

Once upon a time, the Elven Door stood open in those walls,

"Many hundreds of years ago, there was a tower school 
dedicated to the art of alienism, of the art of calling
and controlling beings alien to the near planes of 
existance, the familliar heavens and hells.

"The last master of that school, Daruth, sought 
knowledge beyond his stature, knowledge concerning an
ancient artifact known as the Vast Gate.  Daruth was
censured by Lolth for his hubris, but he chose to 
continue down the forbidden path.  His obsession 
resulted in the destruction of the tower school 
entrusted to him:  Xaxox was consumed by the very 
creatures it existed to control.

"For centuries, it was believed that the Xaxox school
was no more.  Recently, however, the tower has 
reappeared on the surface of the world, near Firestorm
Peak, the secret site of the ancient Vast Gate.

"Lolth has revealed to us, the sacred council of the
matron-mothers, that Daruth Xaxox has returned with 
his tower, and that he plans to spread his heretical
teachings accross the Underdark.  Already we have been
attacked by his followers, who bear a black-web sigil
as a token of their treachery.

"You have been choosen as Lolth's instrument in this.
Travel to the surface of the world, locate Tower
Xaxox near Firestorm Peak, and bring justice to Daruth
before he can endanger more of your brothers with his
heresy.

"Daruth Xaxox brought with him a cloak of woven 
darkness.  Bring this to me as proof of your deed.
Go now!  Bring honor to your house!  Fail, and know 
torment everlasting!"

"I have learned that the foundation of Lolth's 
current power is an ancient pact with a great 
matriarch of spiders; a demon of the old world, 
who's name is forgotten.

"The story of Lolth, then, has two threads: 

"In one, there is a goddess named Araushnee,
a member of the elven pantheon, who tried to
murder and supplant her fellows.  For this,
she was thrown bound and powerless into the 
endless Abyss of the demons, to find 
torment in their clutches.

"In the other thread, there is a Far Realm, 
in which sits a great black web of poison 
strands, of darkness unpierceable, of plots 
indecipherable.  True spiders are the 
servants of this web.  One spider, however, 
stole secrets from the web, and fled with 
her followers across the Realities.

"The threads come together when the fleeing
thief meets the fallen goddess.  The 
goddess took a new name, Lolth; and 
together their followers have spun their
white counterfeit webs for many ages of 
the world.

"But I met the black web, and have told him
the location of his flocks, and he has sent
the shepherds of spiders, the poison-cups 
of the poison-god, to gather them up.

"If we can help them in their task, then
Lolth shall be Araushnee once more, and 
we will be masters of our own fate.

"It falls to you to strike the first blow
in this war, for I am not able to leave
the area surrounding the Vast Gate.  You
must return to %i, and defeat %n,

the few who might hinder our quest."

My greatest rival, sensing an opportunity for further glory,
sent her most talented daughter to the colony, the girl recently
taken by Lolth as her Chosen priestess.  Her mission was to 
learn the cause of the silence and to bring justice to those 
responsible.

victory.  But- She was killed.  At the height of the battle,
an assassin came through the walls from the other side, and 
killed her.

"It was %n, %p.  The second daughter of our house.  She 
killed our mother, and many of our sisters as well.  She had 
a wand, whatever she pointed it at, died.

to show the favor in which our house was held.  You wore it 
yourself, I- I've heard.  But when you left, you left it behind.

salvage something from this.  You'll probably have to kill
%n to get the cloak back, but... In fact I think it 
would be best if you did kill her.

you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Pri 00021
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
of undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
the one carrying %o.

"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
barely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

"Be pure, my %S."
%E
%Cp Pri 00028
"Beware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard."
%E
%Cp Pri 00029
"You may be able to affect %n with magical cold."
%E
%Cp Pri 00030
"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
against %n."
%E
%Cp Pri 00031
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Pri 00032
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
%E
%Cp Pri 00033
"Do not lose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."
%E
%Cp Pri 00034
"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Pri 00035
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%lC.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Pri 00036
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Pri 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
of tortured souls assault your psyche.

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Pri 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Pri 00050
"Ah, so %lC has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

"No, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
after all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
%o."
%E

"So, %r.  Again you challenge me."

"I feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now."
%E
%Cp Pri 00069
"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."

%Cc Pri 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of
%d fill your soul.  You know now why %n stole it from
%H, for with it, %ca of %d could
easily defeat his plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %lC as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Pri 00080
You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %ns body dissolves
into a cloud of noxious gas.

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
    As for thee, %n, I shall deal with thy failure
    at my leisure.

You then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...
%E
%Cc Pri 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
a minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E
%Cc Pri 00082
%l reiterates that %o is yours now.

"The time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.
%Z await your return through the magic portal

"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
%E
%Cc Pri 00091
"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,

"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,

"A short time ago, the mountain centaurs to the east invaded
and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.  The local
leader is now only a figurehead, and serves %n.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
hostile centaurs, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the grove and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground cavern of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will %d be safe."

their ancient feud and now band together against us."

"We cannot hold the grove much longer, %p.  Hurry!"

This must be %i.

You are in a cave built of many different rooms, all interconnected
by tunnels.  Your quest is to find and shoot the evil wumpus that

pits or using up your limited supply of arrows.  Good luck.

You are in room 9 of the cave.  There are tunnels to rooms

Your healing skills tell you that %ns wounds are mortal.

As you bow before %l, he welcomes you:

    You have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.

    While you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in
    the ancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover
    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
    you return with the amulet.

With that, %l bows, and places his sword atop

Once, there was a story:

    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

The various gods and heroes of the world struggled 
mightily to recover the amulet, for the god who reclaimed
the amulet would be granted ascendance over the other 
gods of the world.  Eventually, one such hero recovered
the amulet and bore it up the the Astral Plane in the
name of their god.  The hero was rewarded by their 
ascendent deity with demi-godhood and immortality.

That time is long past.  The ascendance and immortality
of the gods proved a lie, for heaven now lies in ruins,
trampled into the bloody soil of earth by the cursed
mind flayers.

You, a newly trained %r, have been trained
from birth as the instrument of hope in a dying world.
One day soon, when your sister, the Last Oracle Sara,
deems you ready and the Army of the Bastion has 
completed its secret preparations, you shall-
