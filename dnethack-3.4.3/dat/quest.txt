%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
seem to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It feels
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005

%E

"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
# Assumes Itlachiayaque (smooth shield)
%Cc Arc 00082
%l looks over %os polished surface.

"Of all the items that have been excavated from %i,
this one has given us the greatest insight into Toltec civilisation.
Understand that guarding this artifact is no small responsibility,
%p. Now, it is time that you resumed your expedition for the
Amulet. %Z await you through the portal which brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the Astral Plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."

Suddenly, you find yourself back in the warrens surrounding the Last Bastion.
%E
%Cp Ana 00002
Once again, you return to the Last Bastion.
%E
%Cp Ana 00003
You are back at the Last Bastion.

You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Ana 00005
"The sepulchers have opened!  The Seraphs are rising to the surface!"

%E
%Cp Ana 00014
"You retrieved the Annulus?  Why?  It won't save us now."
%E
%Cc Ana 00015
"I'm glad you were able to return.  For you, many days have
gone by since you were sent back, but for us, it's only been
a few minutes.

"The mission to the past was meant to be a one-way trip.
However, our Enemy's attack has forced us to send you 
back prematurely, and to recall you from farther down
the time-stream, in the hopes that you can complete the
final preparations for your mission.

"But, before I can tell you in more detail what you
must do, I must check to see if you have grown strong
enough to withstand the perils ahead."
%E
%Cp Ana 00016
"You have returned from farther down the time-stream, I see.
Let me check if you are strong enough now."
%E
%Cp Ana 00017
"You have traveled quite far down the time-stream now.
Let me check if you are strong enough now."
%E
%Cc Ana 00018
"%p, my %s!  How could you betray us!

"Begone!  Live out what remains of your cursed life in
the doomed, distant past!"
%E
%Cc Ana 00019
"%sC, you are not yet strong enough to undertake the mission
I must give you now.  The army of the bastions has tried, 
and failed, to complete this mission for our entire lives.

Go now, return to the past, and come back to us from farther down
the time-stream."
%E
%Cc Ana 00020
"%sC, I fear that you have strayed from your chosen path.

"The Enemy will exploit any weaknesses in your psyche.  Return
to the past and rededicate yourself to the %a path."
%E
%Cc Ana 00021
"%sC, you may now be ready to undertake the final preparations
for your mission.

"The great Enemy, the Grey Thought Entity called Ilsensine, comes to
Yggdrasil from the Far Realms that lie beyond it.  She entered our
world in the distant past, possibly even through the beginning.  For
eons, she lay dormant as the seed of inspiration, buried in the 
minds of the gods of Law.

"In this age before ages, the mind flayers ruled the universe, having
themselves traveled through far realms to that era from the distant
future.  They learned of that nascent thought, or brought knowledge
of it back from the future, and worshiped it as Ilsensine.

"Before the mind flayers could complete preparations for the rise of
the Enemy, they were overthrown by a revolt of the slave races, and
the great ring of Penumbra was broken.

"But the gods of Law, contemplating the strange natural order of
the mind flayers, stumbled on the Thought, and were consumed by
it.  The other gods of the heavens became aware of the Enemy and
fought against it, but they too were consumed one by one, until only
the gods of the earth remained.

"The mortal races of the earth were trapped between the new God
of the heavens and the old gods of earth.  But they were not
unprepared.

"Our ancestors discovered a silver bell that could open anything.
They turned the power of this bell against itself, opening a ring-
shaped hole in the world through which the foreign Thought Entity
could be ejected from the universe.

"The greatest hero of the age wielded this Annulus in battle
with the servants of Ilsensine, on the day of our birth when the
heavens fell to earth.  The Annulus was lost at Ground Zero in 
the defeat at the Battle of Heavenfall and the Night of Falling
Stars.

"It is too late to employ the Annulus against Ilsensine, for all
the base matter of the world now stirs with her thoughts.  The only
hope is to take the Annulus back into the past, to before Ilsensine
overran the heavens, and employ it against her then.  This is the
great mission for which you have spent your whole life training.

"However, the Annulus remains lost at Ground Zero.  All the 
armies of the Resistance have been unable to penetrate deep 
enough into enemy teritory to reach that place, and now there
are no armies left.  We have no choice but to send you, the Last
Hero of this or any age to come, alone in the hopes that you can
succeed where they failed.  Should you do so, you must return to
me so that I can tell you of the final stage of the plan."
%E
%Cp Ana 00025
"We are the final generation, born the day the heavens fell.  No more
will be born after us, unless you can change the course of history."
%E
%Cp Ana 00026
"The night of falling stars ended coordinated resistance on the
surface.  Only a few underground bastions survived the night."
%E
%Cp Ana 00027
"Should you meet a Dread Seraph, I can only suggest you run."
%E
%Cp Ana 00028
"You should make liberal use of magic maps and object detection."
%E
%Cp Ana 00029
"The Black Flowers are dangerous for their song, not their combat
prowess."
%E
%Cp Ana 00030
"Intoners are fast, seductive warriors, who sing many songs and
cast many spells.  I can only advise you to kill them quickly
from a distance."
%E
%Cp Ana 00031
"Beware the Army of Neverweres, or they will steal your
equipment and your blood."
%E
%Cp Ana 00032
"The remaining Troopers of the Last Bastion will hold the
line as long as they are able."
%E
%Cp Ana 00033
"Those Changed by exposure to the Far Realms of Insanity
require isolation suits to exist in our atmosphere.  If
the suit is breached, the Changed inside will eventually
boil away into poison mist."
%E
%Cp Ana 00034
"I hope you found luck in the past, for there is surely
none left in this fading world."
%E
%Cc Ana 00035
You have reached the ruins of a great city, destroyed in
the rain of falling stars that came after the great defeat
at the Battle of Heavenfall.  Beyond the city you see the
ever-expanding Penumbral zone rising into the night sky.

You will have to pass through the city and the nascent 
Penumbra if you are to reach Ground Zero, where the Annulus
was lost on the Eve of Falling Stars, on the day of your
birth.
%E
%Cp Ana 00036
Once again, you arrive at the ruins of the city.

Sara, the Last Oracle, looks wonderingly at the

our world.

"You must now travel deep into the earth, and
retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, that was stolen by
Moloch at the beginning of time.

"With the Amulet in your possession, the gods will
allow you to climb up to the Astral Plane.  Once
there, you must use the Annulus to Annul the High
Altar of Ilsensine and eject her from this
universe."
%E
%Cc Ana 00082
"The Annulus is the pinnacle of mortal technology, created
by turning the power of the Bell of Opening upon itself,

You have found the Bastions' portal, that leads through time to 
the  warrens surrounding what was the last-surviving Bastion.

Data-sync indicates a hero from the Bastion passed through this 
place on their way to a battle site known as Ground Zero.  
The Annulus, though taken from Ground Zero, has followed the 
unbroken ring of time back to that place.

You should hasten to Ground Zero, for there is nothing for you

The ruins here are just barely recognizable.  In this 
city, there was a laboratory where research into 
autonomous thaumaturgic war machines was conducted.

You came on-line in that laboratory, and underwent 
preliminary testing in and around this city.  As your
sister wrote, it seems the city has since been destroyed
in a meteor bombardment.  Beyond the city you see a growing
disk of distorted matter rising into the night sky.

Suddenly, you see yourself at the surroundings of %H.
You smile as you recognize the land, remembering of the days you lived here,
learning the power of songs over nature, before you went on your voyages 
around the world.

But, wait... something is wrong.  The land looks desolated; the beautiful
river, which flow produced a soft music, now looks dead; the breeze,
once an inspiration to the music students, makes you shiver. The nymphs are
scattered and it seems all the muses abandoned the place. You feel something

cold breeze blows in aimless breaths, bearing the rumor of distant
whispers.

You know this place well; though you have been here but once before,
and that in a dream. That night, as you stood over the strange, dry
corpse that sprawls alone within the shell of this ruined library,
the wind whispered to you with a thousand tounges, speaking the 
names that still ring in your ears, the names that drove you

You reach out as well, and together you bridge the distance.

A bloody form now hangs before you, a form that may once have been
a man, now savaged by great beasts. So violent was the attack that
the beasts' teeth were torn from their sockets, and lodged in the
man's skin. The shear variety of teeth bears mute witness to the
number of assailants that dogged the man.

The thousand whisperers speak as one: "Dahlver-Nar; Dahlver of the
teeth; the first to listen, the first to speak. Dahlver-Nar, of
the Gates of Teeth, who built the way through which we reach."

The bloody form moans in pain and paws at it's ruined, 
toothless mouth with its ruined, tooth-torn hands.

"Another now seeks to close those Gates. A mortal man, who died
and yet walked on, who moulderd to dust, and yet thought on.
Acererak the Devourer, Acererak the skull; who lives and stands
and thinks now on both sides of the Gates, who has but to bite
down, to cut off the breeze through which we talk, to sever

Some strange magic is at work, for your village is not located near

"%pC!  You have sealed our fate.  You seem unable to reform yourself,

"Alas, %p, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.

%d decrees it."

%Cc Cav 00021
"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our caves safe once more.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."

Concentrate on %o."

%Cp Cav 00030
"%oC is the only object that %n truly fears."

%Cp Cav 00034
"If only we had an amulet of reflection, this would not have happened."
%E
%Cc Cav 00035
You %x many large claw marks on the ground.  The tunnels ahead
of you are larger than most of those in any cave complex you have
ever been in before.

Your nose detects the smell of carrion from within, and bones litter
the sides of the tunnels.
%E
%Cp Cav 00036
Once again, you approach %i.
%E
%Cc Cav 00040
You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that
nevertheless show signs of being scorched by fire.

Bones litter the floor, and there are objects scattered everywhere.
The air is close with the stench of sulphurous fumes.

%nC is clearly visible, but she seems to be asleep.

Once again, you find yourself in the lair of %n.

Now I shall kill you."

    To prevent further trouble, I would like you, %p,

Somehow, you have been captured and teleported back to

%Cc Con 00021
"Yes, %p, it looks like you are now ready to
help us.  Things have become much worse since you
left.  The dungeons are overrun by vermin, guards
have become brutal and corrupt, and I believe that
%n has had dealings with dark powers.

"I had spent many years enchanting an iron spoon
with powers to help lead an escape from this place,
turning it into %o.
Unfortunately, %n stole it from me,
likely using it for dark, twisted purposes.

"We need your help to go down to the warden's level
to defeat the corrupt %n and recover

"You should be able to defeat %n easily
enough in a fair fight.  Unfortunately, she doesn't
fight fair."

This must be the level that leads to the warden's
area.  You must be getting closer to

Once again, you find yourself near the entrance to
the warden's area.  Hopefully, you can acquire

%E
%Cc Dna 00021
"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,

"There were lots of dragons in the North in the old days, and
gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves 
flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse.  There
was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug.
One day he flew up into the air and came south.

"Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside - well, from a
good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout
of flame.  The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there
was the dragon waiting for them.  None escaped that way.  Then he
crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and
lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After
that there were no more dwarves left alive inside, and he took 
all their wealth for himself.  Probably has piled it all up in a
great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed.

"The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and
cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father
and grandfather with singed beards.

"I had often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's
escape, but then I was given a map and a key by Gandalf the Grey,
and now I see that they had a private Side-door which only they 
knew about.  And now we mean to get back our stolen treasure,
and bring our curses home to Smaug - if we can.

"I'm still unclear how you came to be here, but if you will help
us, and avenge your people, you have my blessing.  The key is in
this sack here."
%E
%Cp Dna 00025

"It is now many years ago that a shadow of disquiet fell upon
our people. Words began to be whispered in secret: it was
said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater
wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some
spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called
in our own tongue Khazad-dum; and they declared that now at last
we had the power and numbers to return.

"Moria! Moria! Wonder of the northern world! Too deep we delved
there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions 
lain empty since the children of Durin fled. At last, however,
Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though
I did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Oin and
many of our folk, and they went away south.

"For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages reported 
that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there. Then
there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria since.

"It falls to you to travel south to the gates of Moria, to find
what has become of Balin and our people. The forces of the Enemy
are gathering on our eastern borders, and war grows near. Should
we be attacked unlooked for out of the south, by orcs marching
in force from Moria, it would go ill for us indeed."

You find that the Gate-stream has been dammed, turning the

%E
%Cp Elf 00017
"Ah, you are here again, %p.  Allow me to determine your readiness..."
%E
%Cc Elf 00018
"%pC!  You have doomed us all.  You fairly radiate %L influences

"Begone!  We renounce your %shood with us!  You are an outcast now!"
%E
%Cc Elf 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to withstand the demands of that

"You have strayed, %p!  You know that %d requires that

"You must go from us.  Return when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Elf 00021
"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
and why we so desperately need your help:

"A short time ago, a great darkness fell over the greenwood,
and yrch tribes and monstrous spiders came out of the east in
droves. Under their leader, %n, they established
a fortress on Amon Lanc in the south of this... mirkwood.

"During the new moon, we were beset by hordes of orcs and goblins,
as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group, headed by 
%n himself, managed to breach the city and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground castle of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it on his person.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will %d be safe."
%E
%Cp Elf 00025
"It is rumored that the Uruk-hai have a pact 
with the Hill Ogres."
%E
%Cp Elf 00026
"%nC is strong, and very smart."
%E
%Cp Elf 00027
"Use %o, when you find it.  It will help you survive
to reach us."
%E
%Cp Elf 00028
"Remember, let %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Elf 00029
"Call upon %d when you face %n.
The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
%E
%Cp Elf 00030
"%n and his kind have always hated us."
%E
%Cp Elf 00031
"We cannot hold the grove much longer, %p.  Hurry!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00032
"To infiltrate %i, you must be very stealthy."
%E
%Cp Elf 00033
"Remember that %n is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
%E
%Cp Elf 00034
"You can triumph, %p, if you trust in %d."
%E
%Cc Elf 00035
You descend into the outer regions of %i.  You can hear
scuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.

You remember that a %g once told you that there were many secret
passageways in this complex.
%E
%Cc Elf 00036
Once again, you descend into %i.
%E
%Cc Elf 00040
You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
finishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.

Off in the distance, you hear the sounds of a large, raucous gathering.
%E
%Cp Elf 00041
Once again, you enter the distorted castle of the %n.
%E
%Cc Elf 00050
"So, %c.  %lC has sent you to recover %o.

"Well, I shall keep that bauble.  It pleases me.  You, %c, shall die."
%E
%Cp Elf 00051
"Back again, eh?  Well, a mere %r is no threat to me!  Die, %c!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00052
"You haven't learned your lesson, %c.  You can't kill me!  You shall die now."
%E
%Cp Elf 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %r.  Then I shall
kill you."
%E
%Cp Elf 00060
"Your %d is nothing, %c.  You are mine now!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00061
"Run away little %c!  You can never hope to defeat %n!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00062
"My orcish servants will rip you to shreds!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00063
"I shall display your head as a trophy.  What do you think about that wall?"
%E
%Cp Elf 00064
"I shall break your %ls city, and destroy all the %gP!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00065
"%d has abandoned you, %c.  You are doomed."
%E
%Cp Elf 00066
"%rA?  %lC sends a mere %r against me?  Hah!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00067
"%lC has failed, %c.  %oC will never leave here."
%E
%Cp Elf 00068
"You really think you can defeat me, eh %c?  You are wrong!"
%E
%Cp Elf 00069
"You weaken, %c.  I shall kill you now."
%E
%Cc Elf 00070
As you pick up %o, it seems to glow, and a warmth
fills you completely.  You realize that its power is what has protected
your %sp against their enemies for so long.

You must now return it to %l without delay -- their lives depend
on your speed.
%E
%Cc Elf 00080
%nC collapses to the ground, cursing you and %l, then says:

    You have defeated me, %r!  But I curse you one final time, with my
    dying breath!  You shall die before you leave my castle!
%E
%Cc Elf 00081
"%pC!  You have succeeded!  I feared it was not possible!

"You have returned with %o!

"I fear, now, that the Enemy will rise again and plot yet another raid.
But this will take some time, and if you can recover the Amulet of 
Yendor for %d before that happens, we will be eternally safe.

"Take %o with you.  It will aid in your quest for
the Amulet."

the Astral Plane, where the primary circle of %d resides.

"To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to %d.

%Cc Hea 00001
What sorcery has brought you back to %H?  The smell
of fresh funeral pyres tells you that something is amiss with the healing
powers that used to practice here.

No rhizotomists are tending the materia medica gardens, and where are the
common folk who used to come for the cures?

You know that you must quickly make your way to the collegium, and
%ls iatreion, and find out what has happened in your
absence.
%E
%Cp Hea 00002
After your last experience you expected to be here, but you certainly
did not expect to see things so much worse.  This time you must
succeed.
%E
%Cp Hea 00003
Again, you %x %H in the distance.

The smell of death and disease permeates the air.  You do not have
to be %Ra to know that %n is on the verge of victory.
%E
%Cp Hea 00005
"Did you read that new treatise on the therapeutic use of leeches?"
%E
%Cp Hea 00006

%Cp Hea 00007
"I passed handwriting so they are demoting me a rank."
%E
%Cp Hea 00008
"I've heard that even %l has not been able to cure Chiron."
%E
%Cp Hea 00009
"We think %n has used his alchemists, and %o,
to unleash a new disease we call 'the cold' on Gehennom."
%E
%Cp Hea 00010
"Did you read that new treatise on the therapeutic use of leeches?"
%E
%Cp Hea 00011
"Paint a red caduceus on your shield and monsters won't hit you."
%E
%Cp Hea 00012
"How are you feeling?  Perhaps a good bleeding will improve your spirits."
%E
%Cp Hea 00013
"Have you heard the absurd new theory that diseases are caused by

%E
%Cp Hea 00014
"I see that you bring %o, now you can cure this plague!"
%E
%Cc Hea 00015
Feebly, %l raises his head to look at you.

"It is good to see you again, %p.  I see the concern in your
eyes, but do not worry for me.  I am not ready for Hades yet.  We have
exhausted much of our healing powers holding off %n.
I need your fresh strength to carry on our work.

"Come closer and let me lay hands on you, and determine if you have
the skills necessary to accomplish this mission."
%E
%Cp Hea 00016
"Again you return to me, %p.  I sense that each trip back
the pleurisy and maladies of our land begin to infect you.  Let us
hope and pray to %d that you become ready for your task before
you fall victim to the bad humors."
%E
%Cp Hea 00017
"Chiron has fallen, Hermes has fallen, what else must I tell you to
impress upon you the importance of your mission!  I hope that you
have come prepared this time."

"You have failed us, %p.  You are a quack!  A charlatan!

"Hades will be happy to hear that you are once again practicing your
arts on the unsuspecting."
%E
%Cc Hea 00019
"Alas, %p, you are yet too inexperienced to deal with the rigors
of such a task.  You must be able to draw on the knowledge of botany,
vetenary, and alchemy before I can send you on this quest with good
conscience.

"Return when you wear %Ra's caduceus."
%E
%Cc Hea 00020
"You have learned much of the remedies that benefit, but you must also
know which physic for which ail.  That is why %ds teachings are a
part of your training.

"Return to us when you have healed thyself."
%E
%Cc Hea 00021
For the first time, you sense a smile on %ls face.

    You have indeed learned as much as we can teach you in preparation
    for this task.  Let me tell you what I know of the symptoms and hope
    that you can provide a cure.

    A short while ago, the dreaded %nt was fooled by the gods
    into thinking that he could use %o to find a
    cure for old age.  Think of it, eternal youth!  But his good
    health is accomplished by drawing the health from those around him.

    He has exhausted his own supply of healthy people and now he seeks to
    extend his influence into our world.  You must recover from him
    %o and break the spell.

    You must travel into the swamps to %i, and from there
    follow the trail to %ns island lair.  Be careful.
%E

"I have sent for Chiron, but I am afraid he will come too late."
%E
%Cp Hea 00031
"Maybe when you return the snakes will once again begin to shed."
%E
%Cp Hea 00032
"The plague grows worse as we speak.  Hurry, %p!"
%E
%Cp Hea 00033
"Many times %n has caused trouble in these lands.  It is
time that he was eradicated like the diseases he has caused."
%E
%Cp Hea 00034
"With but one eye, %n should be easy to blind.  Remember this."
%E
%Cc Hea 00035
You stand before the entrance to %i.  Strange
scratching noises come from within the building.

The swampy ground around you seems to stink with disease.
%E
%Cp Hea 00036
Once again you stand at the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Hea 00040
You stand within sight of the infamous Isle of %n.  Even
the words of %l had not prepared you for this.

Steeling yourself against the wails of the ill that pierce your ears,
you hurry on your task.  Maybe with %o you can
heal them on your return, but not now.
%E
%Cp Hea 00041
Once again, you %x the Isle of %n in the distance.
%E
%Cc Hea 00050
"They have made a mistake in sending you, %p.

"When I add your youth to mine, it will just make it easier for me
to defeat %l."

"Unlike your patients, you seem to keep coming back, %p!"

%Cp Hea 00052
"Which would you like, %p?  Boils, pleurisy, convulsions?"

%Cp Hea 00053
"I'll have %o back from you, %r.  You are
not going to live to escape this place."
%E
%Cp Hea 00060
"They might as well give scalpels to wizards as to let you try to
use %o!"
%E
%Cp Hea 00061
"If I could strike %l, surrounded by his %gP, imagine what I
can do to you here by yourself."
%E
%Cp Hea 00062
"I will put my %Rp to work making a physic out of your ashes."
%E
%Cp Hea 00063
"As we speak, Hades gathers your patients to join you."
%E
%Cp Hea 00064
"After I'm done with you, I'll destroy %l as well."
%E
%Cp Hea 00065
"You will have to kill me if you ever hope to leave this place."
%E
%Cp Hea 00066
"I will impale your head on my caduceus for all to see."
%E
%Cp Hea 00067
"There is no materia medica in your sack which will cure you of me!"
%E
%Cp Hea 00068
"Do not fight too hard, I want your soul strong, not weakened!"
%E
%Cp Hea 00069
"You should have stopped studying at vetenary."
%E
%Cc Hea 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel its healing begin to
warm your soul.  You curse Zeus for taking it from its rightful owner,
but at least you hope that %l can put it to good use once
again.
%E
%Cc Hea 00080
The battered body of %n slumps to the ground and gasps
out one last curse:

    You have defeated me, %p, but I shall have my revenge.
    How, I shall not say, but this curse shall be like a
    cancer on you.

With that %n dies.
%E
%Cc Hea 00081
As soon as %l sees %o he summons his %gP.

Gently, %l reaches out and touches %o.
He instructs each of the assembled to do the same.  When everyone
has finished he speaks to you.

    Now that we have been replenished we can defeat this plague.  You must
    take %o with you and replenish the worlds you have
    been called upon to travel next.  I wish you could ride Chiron to the
    end of your journey, but I need him to help me spread the cure.  Go
    now and continue your journey.

"You are indeed ready, %r.  This is your mission,
your holy quest from Lolth:

"Many hundreds of years ago, there was a tower school 
dedicated to the art of alienism, of the art of calling
and controlling beings alien to the near planes of 
existance, the familliar heavens and hells.

"The last master of that school, Daruth, sought 
knowledge beyond his stature, knowledge concerning an
ancient artifact known as the Vast Gate.  Daruth was
censured by Lolth for his hubris, but he chose to 
continue down the forbidden path.  His obsession 
resulted in the destruction of the tower school 
entrusted to him:  Xaxox was consumed by the very 
creatures it existed to control.

"For centuries, it was believed that the Xaxox school
was no more.  Recently, however, the tower has 
reappeared on the surface of the world, near Firestorm
Peak, the secret site of the ancient Vast Gate.

"Lolth has revealed to us, the sacred council of the
matron-mothers, that Daruth Xaxox has returned with 
his tower, and that he plans to spread his heretical
teachings accross the Underdark.  Already we have been
attacked by his followers, who bear a black-web sigil
as a token of their treachery.

"You have been choosen as Lolth's instrument in this.
Travel to the surface of the world, locate Tower
Xaxox near Firestorm Peak, and bring justice to Daruth
before he can endanger more of your brothers with his
heresy.

"I have learned that the foundation of Lolth's 
current power is an ancient pact with a great 
matriarch of spiders; a demon of the old world, 
who's name is forgotten.

"The story of Lolth, then, has two threads: 

"In one, there is a goddess named Araushnee,
a member of the elven pantheon, who tried to
murder and supplant her fellows.  For this,
she was thrown bound and powerless into the 
endless Abyss of the demons, to find 
torment in their clutches.

"In the other thread, there is a Far Realm, 
in which sits a great black web of poison 
strands, of darkness unpierceable, of plots 
indecipherable.  True spiders are the 
servants of this web.  One spider, however, 
stole secrets from the web, and fled with 
her followers across the Realities.

"The threads come together when the fleeing
thief meets the fallen goddess.  The 
goddess took a new name, Lolth; and 
together their followers have spun their
white counterfeit webs for many ages of 
the world.

"But I met the black web, and have told him
the location of his flocks, and he has sent
the shepherds of spiders, the poison-cups 
of the poison-god, to gather them up.

"If we can help them in their task, then
Lolth shall be Araushnee once more, and 
we will be masters of our own fate.

"%dC has turned away from you, my "%r." Your faithlessness has
cost you %H and your destiny. Flee into exile
or end your life at the hands of the rebels.

%Cc Nob 00019
"Fool, only as a %R can you hope to put down the rebellion.
You must go out and gather further renown."
%E

"Only with the full support of %d can you succeed.
Go away, and don't return without the favor of %d."
%E
%Cc Nob 00021
"Yes, %r.  The cards say you are ready."

With that, she begins drawing cards from her deck. First is
the zero of trumps, followed swiftly by the queen and seven
of swords.

"After you departed from %H, %n 
and her companions broke into the keep and stole
%o, which symbolizes your right to rule
these lands."

The five of wands joins them on the table, followed by the
five of swords.

"With her stolen authority, %n raised
a peasant revolt and routed your army."

%lC gathers up the cards, suffles the deck, and
resumes drawing. Again, the first card is the zero of trumps,
this time followed by the three and seven of wands, the
queen and ten of swords, and finally the ten of trumps.

"You must travel to %i, slay %n,
and recover %o."

She sits back and fixes you with a piercing stare.

"I'd use the secret passage in your throne room to reach
the forest, if I were you."
%E
%Cp Nob 00025
"You must learn to rely on %d."
%E
%Cp Nob 00026
She draws a card from the center of the deck.
It is the queen of swords.

"A powerful warrior with a silver sword."
%E
%Cp Nob 00027
"Why are you still here?"
%E
%Cp Nob 00028
She deals a card from the bottom of the deck. It is the
queen of wands.

"A woman of nature. She fights with arrows of the moon's metal."

%Cp Nob 00029
"Well, what are you waiting for?"
%E
%Cp Nob 00030
"Get on with it!"

"Your surviving knights still fight the rebels in the woods."
%E
%Cp Nob 00032
"There are still some loyal peasants in the woods."

%Cp Nob 00033
She turns over the top card. It is the five of trumps.

"A holy man.  He can heal his friends and set the sky on fire"
%E
%Cp Nob 00034
She pulls a card from the deck: The one of trumps.

"A man of magic.  At his word the elements rise up and energy
rains down; but as any true mage knows, sleep will kill you
faster than flames!"

Again, you approach %i.

The rebel leaders will be in one of the houses.

As you pick up %o, you feel connected to your land and your people

You feel you should hury back to the keep and take up your throne

%E
%Cc Nob 00080
%nC sinks to her knees, coughing blood. She gasps:

    "Bastard. You may kill me, but you can't kill justice!
    The rebellion is greater than any one person. These people shall

%nC is silent after that, but you remain prudently out of arm's reach
until you are certain she has bled out.
%E
%Cc Nob 00081
"You have returned, %r.  And regained %o, no less."

She flicks a card from her deck, and when it lands at your feet you
see that it is fifteenth trump.

"Isn't your own quest yet unfinished?"
%E
%Cc Nob 00082
%lC studies %o for a moment,
then turns to glare at to you.

"How cruel you are to taunt an old woman. My curse, the curse of

"Why are you back!?  There is nothing left to be done here!"

himself a mighty follower of %d, bested Blackbeard 
at swordplay, sending him tumbling into the caldera. But Blackbeard 
was able to place a mighty curse on %o, and I was 
unable to stop it plunging into the caldera to join him.

%Cc Pri 00018
"You are a heretic, %p!  How can you, %ra, deviate so from the

%Cc Pri 00019
"Alas, %p, it is not yet to be.  A mere %r could never

%Cc Pri 00020
"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the true path!

you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Pri 00021
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, a Legion
of undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
the one carrying %o.

"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
barely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair deep bellow the lowest crypts.  
If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."
%E
%Cp Pri 00025
"You can prevail, if you rely on %d."
%E
%Cp Pri 00026
"Remember that %n has great magic at his command."

"Be pure, my %S."
%E
%Cp Pri 00028
"Beware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard."
%E
%Cp Pri 00029
"You may be able to affect %n with magical cold."
%E
%Cp Pri 00030
"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
against %n."
%E
%Cp Pri 00031
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Pri 00032
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
%E
%Cp Pri 00033
"Do not lose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."

%Cp Pri 00034
"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Pri 00035
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%lC.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Pri 00036
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Pri 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
of tortured souls assault your psyche.

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Pri 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Pri 00050
"ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

"We feel your powers failing you, %r.  you shall die now."

%Cp Pri 00069
"with %o, nothing can stand in Our way."

%Cc Pri 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of

easily defeat their plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %lC as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Pri 00080
You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %n dissolves
into a cloud of noxious gas.

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
    As for 'Thee', o Legion of the damned, 
    I shall deal with thy failure at my leisure.

You then hear the voices of %n, screaming in terror...
%E
%Cc Pri 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
a minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E
%Cc Pri 00082
%l reiterates that %o is yours now.

"The time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.
%Z await your return through the magic portal

%E
%Cp Pri 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
%E
%Cc Pri 00091
"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,

and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.  The local
leader is now only a figurehead, and serves %n.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
hostile centaurs, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the grove and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the

Your healing skills tell you that %ns wounds are mortal.

You know that the bushido tells you to finish him and let his kami

You order that his unwashed head be given to the crows and his body
thrown into the sea.

%Cc Sam 00081
As you bow before %l, he welcomes you:

    You have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.

    While you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in
    the ancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover
    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
    you return with the amulet.

With that, %l bows, and places his sword atop
%o.
%E
%Cc Sam 00082
%l holds %o tightly for a moment, then returns
his gaze to you.

achieve the destiny which awaits you."
