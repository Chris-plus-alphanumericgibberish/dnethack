#
#	Gehennom
#
#	Now re-worked for 3.1, hell is hopefully going to be a little
#	less boring.  Also, in 3.1, the tower is not considered as a
#	part of hell, but is set up as a separate dungeon.
#
#	Gehennom is no longer considered "hellish" as a complete dungeon.
#	That is, fire resistance is no longer a condition for survival in
#	it.  However, Gehennom, and the special levels in it in particular,
#	is abundant with fire traps.  As a result, fire resistance is still
#	a prudent survival strategy in Gehennom.
#
#	Note:	Gehennom *must* be the second dungeon defined so that
#		monsters can properly migrate here under certain
#		circumstances.
#
#	Final layout should be:  3 abyss 3 hell 1 valley 1 cleft 1 sanctum 6 wiz
#		Valley of the Dead, Endless Stair (5 levels), wiz1 - wiz3, 
#		abyss, hell1, abyss, hell2, abyss, fake1 - fake 3, hell3, 
#		vibrating square(maze), sanctum.
