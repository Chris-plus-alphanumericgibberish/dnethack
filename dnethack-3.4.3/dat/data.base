abbot
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

armour*
suit or piece of armor
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another 
	boy and me. He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his 
	mother had made him from her hair. I, on the other hand, had 
	a brand new suit of chain mail. Just before our joust, I asked 
	him what he'd do if he made the team. (I was hoping to be more 
	popular with the ladies.) He said he would be able to save the 
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20 
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me. I insisted we swap 
	armor. He was forced to accept, as it would have been an 
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected 
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor 
	class was that day."

aclys
aglaope
siren
	In Greek mythology, the Sirens were three dangerous bird-women, 
	portrayed as seductresses who lured nearby sailors with their 
	enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of 
	their island. [...] In some later, rationalized traditions, the
	literal geography of the "flowery" island of Anthemoessa, or 
	Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in 
	the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.
	All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

	Their number is variously reported as between two and five. 
	In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, 
	but gives the number of the Sirens as two.  Later writers mention
	both their names and number: some state that there were three, 
	Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia or Parthenope, Ligeia, and 
	Leucosia.

	just as sharp. While they are not constructs, arcadian 
	avengers all resemble each other.

	Arcadian avengers fight on the side of order, and see 
	themselves as a pure force of law. They fight free of 
	hesitation, doubt, or even remorse, and may even come into

	before him and drawn his feet towards it.  Slowly it grew to a
	little globe of pallid light.  Now as he came near, it was
	tinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the
	surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of
	his torch.  At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his
	breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner
	light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug
	it from the heart of the mountain long ago, it  took all light
	that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of
	white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.

	Arkenstone, Heart of the Mountain, property of the King

*shikaga *akauji
	Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
	joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
	government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
	governments was known as the Nambokucho.
	[ Samurai - The Story of a Warrior Tradition, by Cook ]
	
	On July 8, 1336,  he and his samurai entered Kyoto, forced Go-Daigo
	to retire,  after which  he seized  power himself  and installed  a
	puppet prince on the throne  (the current Japanese  imperial family
	are  the   descendants  of  this   puppet  emperor  that   Ashikaga
	installed).
	
	Go-Daigo escaped,  though, wouldn't  admit to  have been  defeated,
	and  opened a new "capital"  in Yoshino (south of  Kyoto), where he
	and few  of his  descendants claimed  to be  running a  government,
	known as  the "Southern Court". The  period between  1337 and 1392,
	when Japan was ruled by two courts, is known as the Nambokucho.
	
	That "government" disappeared, naturally, after a  few generations,
	and Ashikaga's  Muromachi regime lasted for  a long  time. The last
	Ashikaga daimyo in power was the 14th descendant of Takauji.
asmodeus
	The Serpent's Throne filled the mirror, a great hooded viper
	of lustrous ruby that slithered about its own coils. Darkness 
	unfathomable surrounded this throne. Yet, a deeper darkness 
	was hidden within. Then, I saw him. Or rather, I saw Him. 
	Seated upon the Serpent's Throne He looked at me. He looked 
	at me as I sat in what I thought was safety!
	
	The small amount of exposed flesh was flawless, like the 
	purest marble. His attire was like the robes and cloaks of 
	a holy high priest, both regal yet simple in its austerity.
	It did not seem woven from any fabric in this or any other 
	world, but spun from the blackness of the Cosmos itself. In
	the long fingers that rested in his lap He held a ruby 
	scepter, its head an onyx pentagram. For all of this, what 
	I remember more than anything were the eyes. They were large 
	under the heavy brow. Completely red, like blood, those 
	glowing eyes gazed at me. Through me. Into and beyond my soul. 
	They devoured everything I ever was and could be. Despite the 
	pleasant smile on His face, those eyes told me I was less than
	nothing, an object to be used and discarded as necessary.

	carefree but when angered, her eyes glow with flames and her 
	usually musical voice becomes very harsh. She is only five and 
	a half feet in height.
	
	Baalphegor is said to have been around since the creation of 
	Baator itself. She's a very skilled diplomat and tactician, and 
	an unmatched sorceress. She has created many artifacts and 
	techniques used throughout the Nine Hells. In addition to her 
	status, this fact granted her a deep respect from almost everyone
	in Baator, even from Asmodeus, who appreciates her to the point 
	of letting her live with her ever-scheming consort.
	
	Knowing all too well her master's position, Baalphegor keeps her 
	goals to herself, acting with a minimal degree of loyalty to the 
	Lord of the Eighth. Mephistopheles tolerates this due to the 
	protection given by his consort's presence.

	Crimson scales cover this large fiend, from its bestile head
	to its clawed toes. From its back spread great batlike wings.
	Foul green venom drips from its teeth, sending up streams of
	smoke wherever it falls. Cinched around its waist is a belt
	of a dozen shrieking angel heads, their necks neatly severed
	by the massive flaming sword the creature holds in his
	clawed fist.
		[ Tyrants of the Nine Hells,
			by Robin Laws and Robert Schwalb ]
	
	Why there must be consorts, I do not know. But I understand. 
	My love says that there must be balance in a layer between 
	anima and animus. Even the writhing Zariel has a consort, 
	her warrior Bel.
	
	My daughters, he told us. And my son, my Bel. You shall be 
	my eyes, ears, and tongue among the nine. Where they plot

baelnorn
	Baelnorn are elves who have sought undeath to serve their 
	families, communities, or other purposes (usually to see a 
	wrong righted, or to achieve a certain magical discovery or 
	deed). They are lifelike creatures that appear as tall, 
	impressive-looking elves with shriveled skin and glowing 
	white eyes. Most baelnorns keep to the crypts, ruins, or 
	mage-towers they guard or work in, and they are never seen 
	except by those who intrude into such places.

b*lzebub
	The "lord of the flies" is a translation of the Hebrew
	Ba'alzevuv (Beelzebub in Greek).  It has been suggested that
	it was a mistranslation of a mistransliterated word which
	gave us this pungent and suggestive name of the Devil, a
	devil whose name suggests that he is devoted to decay,
	destruction, demoralization, hysteria and panic...

balrog
	...  It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as
	if a cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped
	the fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed
	about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air.  Its streaming
	mane kindled, and blazed behind it.  In its right hand
	was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it
	held a whip of many thongs.
	'Ai, ai!' wailed Legolas.  'A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!'

baluchitherium
titanothere
	Extinct rhinos include a variety of forms, the most
	spectacular being _Baluchitherium_ from the Oligocene of
	Asia, which is the largest known land mammal.  Its body, 18
	feet high at the shoulder and carried on massive limbs,
	allowed the 4-foot-long head to browse on the higher branches
	of trees.  Though not as enormous, the titanotheres of the
	early Tertiary were also large perissodactyls, _Brontotherium_
	of the Oligocene being 8 feet high at the shoulder.

	He took another step and she cocked her right wrist in
	viciously.  She heard the spring click.  Weight slapped into
	her hand.
	"Here!" she shrieked hysterically, and brought her arm up in
	a hard sweep, meaning to gut him, leaving him to blunder
	around the room with his intestines hanging out in steaming
	loops.  Instead he roared laughter, hands on his hips,
	flaming face cocked back, squeezing and contorting with great
	good humor.
	"Oh, my dear!" he cried, and went off into another gale of
	laughter.
	She looked stupidly down at her hand.  It held a firm yellow
	banana with a blue and white Chiquita sticker on it.  She
	dropped it, horrified, to the carpet, where it became a
	sickly yellow grin, miming Flagg's own.
	"You'll tell," he whispered.  "Oh yes indeed you will."
	And Dayna knew he was right.

bandersnatch
	But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
		A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
	And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
		For he knew it was useless to fly.
	
	He offered large discount—he offered a check
		(Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
	But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
		And grabbed at the Banker again.
	
	Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws
		Went savagely snapping around—
	He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
		Till fainting he fell to the ground.
	The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
		Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
	And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"
		And solemnly tolled on his bell.

banshee
	In Irish folklore and that of the Western Highlands of Scotland,
	a female fairy who announces her presence by shrieking and wailing

	They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide
	gulf between them and the Cimmerian.  They were sons of
	civilization, reverted to a semi-barbarism.  He was a
	barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians.  They had

bat or bird
	A bat, flitting in the darkness outside, took the wrong turn
	as it made its nightly rounds and came in through the window
	which had been left healthfully open.  It then proceeded to
	circle the room in the aimless fat-headed fashion habitual
	with bats, who are notoriously among the less intellectually

bear trap
	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap. It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle. When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place. Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place. The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape. More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff. They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also

	The tissue injury resulting from frostbite is produced in two ways. The most 
	obvious is actual freezing of the tissues. Although ice crystals form between 
	the cells and grow by extracting water from them, the cells are physically 
	disrupted by the ice crystals only to a limited extent. The dehydration and 
	osmotic and chemical imbalances resulting from  extraction of water from within 
	the cell injure them, but permanent damage may be small. (...) The second 
	mechanism of tissue injury by frostbite, which is much more significant is loss
	of blood supply to the tissues. Blood may flow through larger vessels but (one 
	of the signs of adequate rewarming is a flushing of the frozen area) oxygen 
	cannot be deliver to the tissues because the small blood vessels that would 
	carry it have been lost.

	The most distinguishing feature of Bloodbloaters which set them

	When in contact with prey, Bloodbloaters move into contact as a 
	swarm and exude digestive enzymes from thin red flagellum that are
	attached to the brain. The digestive enzymes eat through cloth and
	flesh as a acid - and once in contact with the blood-stream, act 
	as a anesthetic. Thus - it is not unheard of for a person to

	I worked the lever well under, and stretched my back; the end

	my way.  It was lucky I had brought a longer lever.  It would
	just reach to wedge under the oak root.
	Bearing it down so far would have been easy for a heavy man,
	but was a hard fight for me.  But this time I meant to do it
	if it killed me, because I knew it could be done.  Twice I

	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be

	carrying.

	Bugbears are giant, hairy  cousins of goblins who frequent the same

	muscular, standing 7' tall.  Their hides range from light yellow to
	yellow brown  and their  thick coarse  hair varies  in colour  from
	brown  to  brick  red.  Though  vaguely   humanoid  in  appearance,
	bugbears seem to contain the  blood of some large  carnivore. Their
	eyes recall  those of  some savage  bestial animal, being  greenish
	white with  red pupils, while their  ears are  wedge shaped, rising
	from the  top of  their heads. A  bugbear's mouth  is full of  long
	sharp fangs.
	Bugbears have two main goals  in life: survival and  treasure. They
	are  superb  carnivores,  winnowing  out  the   weak  and  careless

	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The

*cat lord
	Elder Goddess of cats, earthly knowledge of the true name 
	and nature of this being was already becoming confused by
	the time of ancient Egypt. It is believed that the Cat Lord
	entered into some pact or covenant with the rulers of this 
	early nation. However, the terms of this agreement, down to 
	the correct pronunciation of the unprecidented hieroglyphs 
	found in the being's name, have long since been lost, though
	the goddesses _Bastet_ and _Sekhmet_ are believed to be 
	descended from the stories surrounding the Cat Lord and its
	agreement.
	
	The hieroglyphs enclosed within its cartouche are drawn with
	variable numbers of strokes, though no glyph requires more
	than seven strokes to draw. The fourth and fifth and the
	eight and ninth hieroglyphs are smaller than the average,
	but must be drawn as pairs. The completed cartouche contains
	nine hieroglyphs.
s*d*g*r* cat
	Imagine a sealed container, so perfectly constructed that no
	physical influence can pass either inwards or outwards across its
	walls.  Imagine that inside the container is a cat, and also a
	device that can be triggered by some quantum event.  If that event
	takes place, then the device smashes a phial containing cyanide and
	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the
	decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat
	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably
	protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector
	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's
	linear combination has no relevance.

kitten
	Well-known quadruped domestic animal from the family of
	predatory felines (_Felis ochreata domestica_), with a thick,
	soft pelt; often kept as a pet.  Various folklores have the
	cat associated with magic and the gods of ancient Egypt.
	
	So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people

	Now it was light enough to leave.  Moon-Watcher picked up
	the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent
	under the low overhang of the cave.  Once outside, he
	threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright - the
	only animal in all this world able to do so.
	Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant.  He was
	nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished
	weighed over a hundred pounds.  His hairy, muscular body
	was halfway between ape and man, but his head was already
	much nearer to man than ape.  The forehead was low, and
	there were ridges over the eye sockets, yet he unmistakably
	held in his genes the promise of humanity.

	'Twas in a land unkempt of life's red dawn; 
	Where in his sanded cave he dwelt alone;

	By night stole forth and slew the savage boar, 
	So that he loomed a hunter of loud fame, 
	And many a skin of wolf and wild-cat wore, 
	And counted many a flint-head to his name; 
	Wherefore he walked the envy of the band, 
	Hated and feared, but matchless in his skill. 
	Till lo! one night deep in that shaggy land, 
	He tracked a yearling bear and made his kill; 
	Then over-worn he rested by a stream, 
	And sank into a sleep too deep for dream.

*centaur
	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

kerberos
	Cerberus, (or Kerberos in Greek), was the three-headed dog
	that guarded the Gates of Hell.  He allowed any dead to enter,
	and likewise prevented them all from ever leaving.  He was
	bested only twice:  once when Orpheus put him to sleep by
	playing bewitching music on his lyre, and the other time when
	Hercules confronted him and took him to the world of the
	living (as his twelfth and last labor).

	A small lizard perched on a brown stone.  Feeling threatened by
	the approach of human beings along the path, it metamorphosed

	Bink smiled.  These conversions weren't real.  It had assumed
	the forms of obnoxious little monsters, but not their essence.
	It could not sting, stink or burn.  It was a chameleon, using
	its magic to mimic creatures of genuine threat.

	Dantes rapidly cleared away the earth around the chest.  Soon
	the center lock appeared, then the handles at each end, all
	delicately wrought in the manner of that period when art made
	precious even the basest of metals.  He took the chest by the
	two handles and tried to lift it, but it was impossible.  He
	tried to open it; it was locked.  He inserted the sharp end
	of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and pushed down
	on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
	Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his
	gun and placed it beside him.  Then he closed his eyes like a
	child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
	The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
	were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold
	ingots packed in orderly stacks.  From the third compartment,
	which was half full, Dantes picked up handfuls of diamonds,

cockatrice
	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
	just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
	to wither.
	
	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
	sicken and die.

	want to do this.  Swords usually resist all attempts to
	raise their Curses.  Your best source is to hide the Sword

cwn*n
	A pack of snow-white, red-eared spectral hounds which
	sometimes took part in the kidnappings and raids the
	inhabitants of the underworld sometimes make on this world
	(the Wild Hunt).  They are associated in Wales with the sounds
	of migrating wild geese, and are said to be leading the souls
	of the damned to hell.  The phantom chase is usually heard or
	seen in midwinter and is accompanied by a howling wind.

cyclops
	The one-eyed giants, the cyclops, were the forgers of Zeus's 
	thunderbolts. Zeus killed Apollo's son Asclepius (Aesculapius)
	with one such thunderbolt in retribution for Asclepius giving
	mortals the skills to evade death, thus upsetting the natural
	order of the world. Apollo responded by slaying the cyclops.

	And after he had milked his cattle swiftly,
	he again took hold of two of my men
	and had them as his supper.
	Then I went, with a tub of red wine,
	to stand before the Cyclops, saying:
	"A drop of wine after all this human meat,
	so you can taste the delicious wine
	that is stored in our ship, Cyclops."
	He took the tub and emptied it.
	He appreciated the priceless wine that much
	that he promptly asked me for a second tub.
	"Give it", he said, "and give me your name as well".
			...
	Thrice I filled the tub,
	and after the wine had clouded his mind,
	I said to him, in a tone as sweet as honey:
	"You have asked my name, Cyclops?  Well,
	my name is very well known.  I'll give it to you,
	if you give me the gift you promised me as a guest.
	My name is Nobody.  All call me thus:
	my father and my mother and my friends."
	Ruthlessly he answered to this:
	"Nobody, I will eat you last of all;
	your host of friends will completely precede you.
	That will be my present to you, my friend."
	And after these words he fell down backwards,
	restrained by the all-restrainer Hupnos.
	His monstrous neck slid into the dust;
	the red wine squirted from his throat;
	the drunk vomited lumps of human flesh.

	Darkness Given Hunger is the largest black pudding known. 
	It was possessed by a hezrou demon at Juiblex's command, and 
	then an Imprison Possessor spell was cast upon the fusion, 
	making it permanent. For centuries, the demon has dwelled 
	within the pudding, and the two have truly become one in the

# includes "dart trap"
dart*
	Darts are missile weapons, designed to fly such that a sharp, 
	often weighted point will strike first. They can be distinguished
	from javelins by fletching (i.e., feathers on the tail) and a shaft
	that is shorter and/or more flexible, and from arrows by the fact
	that they are not of the right length to use with a normal bow.

Daruth Xaxox
	Past the edge of reality is a relic from the Material Plane: a 
	stone keep securely lashed to the trunk of a dessicated tree a 
	mile in diameter. This was an outpost of mages too intent on 
	discovering forbidden knowledge to fear for their own sanity. 
	Nor do they fear insanity now, for rational thought has departed
	those who still live. Amid the wreckage of a laboratory, 
	barracks, kitchen, small library, and specimen cells, some 
	powerful spellcasters and their servants yet wander. Daruth 
	Winterwood, an ancient elven mage, led the expedition, but 
	now his brain is full of spiders. Literally.
	
	Still, he seeks to return Xaxox to the Material Plane in one 
	piece. Every now and then he coaxes open a small portal, allowing
	the essence of the Far Realm to seep onto some random plane, 
	troubling the dreams of those who reside there. Should Daruth 
	ever attract assistance from those on the far side of his 
	portals, or manage to transfer Xaxox on his own, a permanent 
	portal between the Far Realm and the Material Plane could open. 
	Anticipation of the tidal wave of insanity that would follow is 
	the delight that continues to inspire Daruth's mania.

	monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well. 
	Of their faces and forms I dare not speak in detail; for the

demi*lich
	The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich.
	Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as
	the power which has sustained its physical form gradually begins to
	fail. In most cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull,
	some bones, and a pile of dust. 
	When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the
	lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to
	even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body
	at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done
	centuries ago.

demogorgon
	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the

	brought death and disaster.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]
	
	Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can
	spread a quickly fatal illness to his victims while rending

	mortal may meet his gaze and live to tell of it.
	
	The demon towers over you, his body at once sinuous like
	that of a snake and powerful like that of a great ape. Two
	baleful baboon heads leer from atop his lumbering shoulders,
	attached to which are two long, bifurcated tentacles. His

	iron, fire or any other means, unless it is placed in the hot blood
	of a goat; with sharp pieces of diamond other stones are engraved and
	polished. It is no greater than a small nut. There are six kinds,
	however Adamant attracts metal; it expels venom; it produces amber
	(and is efficacious against empty fears and for those resisting spells).
	It is found in India, in Greece and in Cyprus, where magicians make use
	of it. It gives you courage; it averts apparitions; it removes anger and
	quarrels; it heals the mad; it defends you from your enemies. It should be

dilithium*
	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary 
	"minerals" of Star Trek is dilithium. ... Because of this
	mineral's central role in the storyline, a whole mythology
	surrounds it. It is, however, a naturally occurring substance
	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort. That said, the real mineral that 
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate. 
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general 
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a 
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the 
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27. A 
	mineral with this composition could theoretically exist, although
	it is doubtful that it would possess the more fantastic properties
	ascribed to dilithium.

dunce*
	A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's cap,
	or dunce's hat, is a tall conical hat. In popular culture, it
	is typically made of paper and often marked with a D, and given
	to schoolchildren to wear as punishment for being stupid or
	lazy. While this is now a rare practice, it is frequently depicted
	in popular culture such as children's cartoons.

~dungeon fern*
dungeon*
	At once as far as Angels kenn he views 
	The dismal Situation waste and wilde, 
	A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round 
	As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames 
	No light, but rather darkness visible 
	Serv'd only to discover sights of woe, 
	Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace 
	And rest can never dwell, hope never comes 
	That comes to all; but torture without end 
	Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed 
	With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd: 
	Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd 
	For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd

	As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.

~dwarf ??m*
dwarf*
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

earendil
elwing
	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and
	Men became estranged, as he most wished, those of the Elven-race
	that lived still in Middle-earth waned and faded, and Men usurped
	the sunlight.  Then the Quendi wandered in the lonely places of the
	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the
	offspring of elf and mortal, Earendil, and Elwing, and Elrond
	their child.

edderkop
	Ettercaps resemble hunched, grey-purplish humanoid aberrations with 
	distended white underbellies, spider-like faces (fangs and eyes and 
	such), and two sharp, black chitinous claws instead of hands and 
	feet. They are not particularly intelligent. Ettercaps possess the 
	capability to shoot sticky webs and have an affinity for monstrous 
	spiders, which they keep as pets and guards. They are cowardly and 
	vicious, and prefer to set traps to ensnare their enemies.
		[ Adapted from the Forgotten Realms Wiki]
	
	The edderkops found in the Dungeons of Doom are dark brown or black
	in color, and are known to be shadowsmiths of fearsome power. The

	The behaviour of eels in fresh water extends the air of

	[...]  Eels are voracious carnivores, feeding mainly at
	night and consuming a wide variety of fishes and invertebrate
	creatures.  Contrary to earlier thinking, eels seek living
	rather than dead creatures and are not habitual eaters of
	carrion.

eladrin
	The eladrins are the native race of Arborea, just as the
	devils are associated with the Nine Hells and the demons with
	the Abyss. They're wild and free beings who exult in their own
	existence and live a life of song and celebration. The eladrins
	aid all people of good hearts against the forces of evil, but
	seek to do so with individual acts of kindness or heroism.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
noviere*
water dolphin*
	The seas and islands of Ossa, the second layer of Arborea, are
	the home of the noviere eladrins. Like the bralani, the novieres
	are a people who celebrate the beauty of the lands and emerald
	waters around them. They're the most straightforward and
	approachable of the eladrins. The shieres are blocks of ice to
	the typical cutter traveling in Arborea, the bralani are fickle
	and flighty, and trying to talk seriously to a coure can drive a
	sod barmy – but the novieres're willing to take a basher at his
	word and deal with him the way he deals with them.

	The novieres appear to be aquatic elves or nixies. Their skins
	are greenish, blue, or golden in hue, and their hair ranges from
	deep blue-green to pale blond. They're equally at home in the
	water or on land. The novieres're somewhat more human in
	appearance than a full-blooded aquatic elf; they're stockier,
	and have no prominent gills or webbing in their fingers. Their
	eyes mirror the color of the seas around them. In addition to
	their demihuman form, novieres can take on the shape of golden
	dolphins made entirely of shimmering water.

	Novieres prefer to remain in the seas of Ossa, but sometimes
	journey to other planes or prime-material worlds to visit with
	ocean nymphs or merfolk. They love exploring a new coastline or
	listening to the sound of the surf on a strange shore. Of all
	eladrins, the novieres are most likely to be interested in trade
	or material things; they're fascinated by gemstones and jewelry.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
bralani*
singing sand*
	The snowy, sandy wastes of Pelion are home to the bralani 
	eladrins. They're the wildest and most feral of their kind,
	existing from heartbeat to heartbeat in a glorious, never-ending
	passion. No eladrin can match the fury of an angry bralani, or
	the keening depths of her grief or sorrow, or the blissful
	heights of her joy. Bralani are tied to the plains of Pelion,
	but may occasionally be found dancing in the desert winds or
	arctic wastes of other realms, exulting in their freedom and
	the beauty of the open land.

	Bralani in their demihuman form resemble short, stocky elves,
	broad in the shoulders but graceful nonetheless. Their hair is
	usually a bright silvery-white, and their eyes are an
	everchanging rainbow of hues that flicker and shift with the
	vagaries of the bralani's mood. Bralani can also take the shape
	of a whirlwind of dust, sand, or snow, racing across their
	beloved plains like living zephyrs.

	Bralani are the most distant and fey of the eladrins, dangerous
	to approach and fickle in temperament. Strangers might be 
	greeted with wild celebration or attacked in a towering rage.
	Although the bralani's purpose seems to be to dance and race
	about in the wastes, they'll drop their endless dance in a
	moment if they come across evil in their domain. A few rare and
	unusual bralani sojourning in other worlds ally themselves with
	the local forces of good, siding with a tribe of noble desert
	savages or aiding a group of northern herdsmen.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
firre*
dancing flame*
	It shouldn't be any surprise that there are eladrins who devote
	themselves to art, music, and magic. The firres (pronounced
	feers) are creatures who live for beauty; their lives are
	consumed by a fiery passion for art of any kind, and they
	strive to make their own existence a living image of wonder
	and delight.

	The firre eladrins live as wandering minstrels and bards in
	Arborea, attending the courts of more powerful eladrins or
	tarrying to entertain a circle of coures in a forgotten dell.
	Their pursuit of beauty leads them to any place where art,
	skill, or grace is held in high esteem. A body could run
	across a firre traveling the Outlands or visiting the palaces
	of neutral-aligned powers just as easily as he'd find one in
	Arborea. Firres have a deep love and appreciation of mortal
	art, and often embark on lengthy sojourns on the Prime
	Material Plane to seek out works of excellence.

	In their demihuman, firre eladrins resemble stocky elves with
	brilliant red hair and fiery red eyes. At first glance, a
	firre might be taken for a half-elf, but her eyes give her
	away; they have no iris or pupil, and glow brightly with the
	firre's inner flame. Firres can also transform themselves
	into man-size pillars or balls of fire.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
shiere*
ball of light
	The warriors of Arborea are the shieres, graceful eladrin 
	knights who fight with skill, strength, and honor. They're
	the defenders of the eladrin courts, a shining host that
	seeks out evil intruders and ensures that no darkness will
	trouble the Queen of Stars or her people. By night the
	shieres gather together in bright companies to ride the
	wilds of Olympus and drive away any who would do the folk
	of Arborea harm.

	The shieres appear to be exceptionally tall high elves of
	some kind. They're long-limbed and slender, with lanky
	frames and long, narrow faces and hands. A shiere's as
	strong as the mightiest mortal warrior despite his slender
	build. All shieres are very fair-skinned, with pale golden
	or silver hair and piercing eyes of blue, green, or violet.

	Unlike the other eladrins, shieres're bound more permanently
	into their demihuman form and can change shape only into a
	harmless ball of faerie-light, similar to that of a coure
	eladrin.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
ghaele*
luminous cloud*
	The ghaeles are the knights errant of the eladrins. Wherever
	evil and tyranny raise their ugly heads, the ghaeles respond.
	Working behind the scenes, they quietly muster resistance and
	offer guidance to any creatures of good heart with the courage
	to stand against their oppressors. More than any other
	eladrins, the ghaeles are accustomed to working from behind
	the veil.

	Ghaeles resemble tall, athletic high elves. They might easily
	be taken noble elves if not for their pearly, opalescent eyes
	and radiant aura. Of course, a ghaele may be wearing any
	manner of mortal guise when encountered away from Arborea.
	Ghaele eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal cloud
	of luminous energy.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
tulani*
ball of radiance
	The greatest of the eladrins are the tulani, or faerie lords.
	Their courts are scattered throughout Olympus, never staying
	in the same place more than one night. The tulani are
	peaceful in nature and take up arms only when Arborea itself
	is threatened or the direst of emergencies requires their
	attention.

	Tulani're creatures of unearthly beauty and grace; their
	voices are living music, and their faces shine so brightly
	that mortals find it difficult to look at them. In form
	they're tall, stately elven lords dressed in shimmering
	robes of shifting color. A tulani is surrounded by a magical
	aura that evil creatures cannot bear to be near. Tulani
	eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal globe of
	eldritch colors, 5' in diameter.

	Visitors to Arborea who seek out the tulani courts soon find
	out that the eladrins aren't easy to find when they want to
	avoid someone. When a cutter finally gets to meet with a
	tulani, he's wise to keep his bone-box shut and mind his
	manners. The tulani don't tolerate insolence or disrespect
	from mortals, but are gracious hosts when their guests
	behave themselves.

	The elder brain is a huge, fibrous mass of cognizant brain 
	tissue covered with writhing feelers. A single elder brain 
	floats within the depths of a briny pool found at the center 
	of its illithid community.
	
	The elder brain is the center of its illithid community, 
	serving as an advisor and, most importantly, the living 
	repository of the community's technology, history, and psionic 
	expertise. It is the right and obligation of every illithid to 
	merge with the elder brain after death – living in exalted 
	mentality while guiding and shepherding its erstwhile 
	community. While most illithids believe that their personality 
	will survive the transition, individual egos are suborned to 
	the gestalt consciousness suffusing the tissue mass.

*elder sign
*eye of yggdrasil
	An strange symbol that has come down to the younger races out

	The sign is effective alone, or in groups of up to six; five 
	forming a star around the first: three above and two below.
	
	A simple elder sign is composed of six strokes; however, due
	to the more complex star shape of the reinforced ward, 
	expanding the sign requires ten strokes for the first arm,
	and eight thereafter.

~violet fungus
*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

githyanki*
	Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell 
	upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war 
	on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the 
	githzerai.

	Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are 
	approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and 
	long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black 
	eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman 
	races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. 
	Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their 
	baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, 
	beads, and precious metals and gems.

	History provides some information on the githyanki – their race 
	is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were 
	humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and 
	cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and 
	the people harbored a deep resentment toward the illithids. For 
	centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not 
	summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for 
	many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an 
	opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman 
	of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. 
	She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. 
	The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people 
	freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the 
	githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).

gold
gold piece
	A metal of characteristic yellow colour, the most precious

	and ductile of all metals, and very heavy (sp. gr., 19.3).
	It is quite unalterable by heat, moisture, and most
	corrosive agents, and therefore well suited for its use in
	coin and jewelry.

gold golem
	The bellows he set away from the fire, and gathered all the tools
	wherewith he wrought into a silver chest; and with a sponge wiped
	he his face and his two hands withal, and his mighty neck and
	shaggy breast, and put upon him a tunic, and grasped a stout staff,
	and went forth halting; but there moved swiftly to support their
	lord handmaidens wrought of gold in the semblance of living maids.
	In them is understanding in their hearts, and in them speech and

*golem
	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
	destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
	left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in
	the Old Synagogue." ...

gorgoneion
	Among the Ancient Greeks the most widely-used image intended to 
	avert evil was that of the Gorgon, the head of which now may be 
	called the Gorgoneion, which features wild eyes, fangs, and 
	protruding tongue. The full figure of the Gorgon holds the apex 
	of the oldest remaining Greek temple where she is flanked by two 
	lionesses. The Gorgon head was mounted on the aegis and shield 
	of Athena.

	head of the awakened Gug sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled 
	into view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side, shaded

	Its strings break only in very rare instances, usually
	because the Harper is sulking or crossed in love.  This is
	just as well as no one seems to make or sell spare strings.
	[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]
	
	After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: "Wife, wife,
	bring me my golden harp."  So she brought it and put it on

	ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
	Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down
	like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the
	table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and
	dashed with it towards the door.  But the harp called out
	quite loud: "Master!  Master!" and the ogre woke up just in
	time to see Jack running off with his harp.

halberd
	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe 
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle, 
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact 
	upon an enemy. This alone makes it quite distinct from an 
	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length, 
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by 
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward. 
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay 
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when 
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was 
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a 
	hook for dismounting opponents.

	The other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark,
	powerful man who stood at the head of the sarcophagus whispered:

	But none looked aside from the mummy case over which the man
	in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming
	jewel, while he muttered an incantation that was old when
	Atlantis sank.  The glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so
	that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a
	splintering crash, the carven lid of the sarcophagus burst
	outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
	within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
	occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
	brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.

hell hound*
	Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of
	existence brought here in the service of evil beings.  A hell
	hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red-brown fur,
	and red, glowing eyes.  The markings, teeth, and tongue are
	soot black.  It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder
	and has a distinct odour of smoke and sulphur.  The baying
	sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that sends a shiver
	through any who hear them.
	
	But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his
	lips parted in amazement.  At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell
	of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I sprang
	to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by
	the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of
	the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not
	such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its
	open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle
	and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame. Never
	in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more
	savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that dark
	form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.

*heptagram
	The heptagram, a sevenpointed star, is an obvious development 
	of the pentagram, once it was discovered. The number seven is
	well known in symbolism. The traditional seven planets (the 
	wandering celestial bodies as opposed to the fixed stars) were
	associated with seven celestial spheres, thus the old 
	expression "to be in seventh heaven". The names of the seven
	days of the week may have been derived from the ordering of 
	planets based on orbital period according to the paths of the
	heptagram.
		[ Adapted from symbols.com, the online encyclopedia of
			Western signs and ideograms ]
	
	The heptagram ward requires 21 strokes to draw, and is one of
	the most broadly effective wards. It may be reinforced up to
	seven times.
*hexagram
	The hexagram is based on the triangle gestalt. The earliest
	examples found are dated back to around 800-600 B.C. 
	If the structure had been designed by a process of random 
	experimentation with the basic gestalt, the hexagram as 
	graphically simpler than the pentagram would have been 
	created long before it. Present archeological and historical
	facts, however, indicate that it first appeared at least
	3,000 years later than the pentgram. It is sometimes reffered 
	to as Solomon's seal, though the sign on Solomon's seal is 
	believed to have been a pentagram, and it is frequently used 
	in the magic formulas in the old book of witchcraft, 
	The Key of Solomon.
	
    The alchemists of the Middle Ages used the hexagram first and 
	foremost as a general symbol representing the art of alchemy 
	and secondly as a sign for combinations of water and fire. 
	Combined these two triangles formed the symbol for fire water, 
	the essence or spiritus of wine: alcohol. It was also used as
	a sign for quintessence, the fifth element. 
		[ Adapted from symbols.com, the online encyclopedia of
			Western signs and ideograms ]
	
	Composed of just twelve strokes, the hexagram can be drawn 
	fairly quickly. It may be reinforced up to seven times.
hermes
	Messenger and herald of the Olympians.  Being required to do
	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said
	to have invented, among other things, the lyre, Pan's Pipes,
	numbers, the alphabet, weights and measures, and sacrificing.

hippocrates
	Greek physician, recognized as the father of medicine.  He
	is believed to have been born on the island of Cos, to have
	studied under his father, a physician, to have traveled for
	some time, perhaps studying in Athens, and to have then
	returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The
	Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of
	enormous importance in separating medicine from superstition
	and philosophic speculation, placing it on a strictly
	scientific plane based on objective observation and critical
	deductive reasoning.

		[ The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	
	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
	numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
	and quiet and good tilled earth:  a well-ordered and well-
	farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they
	were, as a rule, shy of "the Big Folk", as they call us, and
	now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find.

hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul

	of the brownie type.  In "A midsummer night's dream" a
	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
	heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

	beasts saying, Come and see.  And I saw, and behold a white
	horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given
	unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
	
	[War:] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the
	second beast say, Come and see.  And there went out another
	horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon
	to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one
	another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
	
	[Famine:] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the
	third beast say, Come and see.  And I beheld, and lo a black
	horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his
	hand.  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say,
	A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley
	for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
	
	[Death:] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the
	voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.  And I looked, and
	behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death,

imp or minor demon
	 ... imps ... little creatures of two feet high that could

		[ The Charwoman's Shadow, by Lord Dunsany ]
	
	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from
	hell is hard to make, and many in the Celtic countries as
	well as the English Puritans regarded all fairies as devils.

incantifier
	Several centuries ago, there existed a faction, now almost 
	entirely extinct, called nowadays 'The Incantifers', then 
	simply as The Magicians or The Wanters. They believed that 
	magic, specifically arcane magic, was the key to power, 
	indeed the only power that mattered in the multiverse. Gain 
	enough knowledge of magic and skill in it and you could do 
	anything. Even challenge The Lady....
	
	According to legend, at least two members of the Wanters 
	tried just that. They died, horribly and spectacularly. 
	Legend also says that one of them almost succeeded.
	
	Then one day, they vanished. Cutters looked up one 
	morning and the Tower Sorcerous, the faction headquarters 
	of the Wanters was simply gone. Nearly all of their 
	members vanished with it, though a scant few remain to 
	wander the planes.

	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by

	To live a fool and die a sage.

~kobold ??m*
~winged kobold
*kobold*
	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
*kop*
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.
	
	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both
	poetry and philosophy in this fact, but most of all, there is
	humor.  Sennett got the humor.)

kraken
	"Below the thunders of the upper deep; 
	Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea, 
	His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep 
	The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee 
	About his shadowy sides: above him swell 
	Huge sponges of millennial growth and height; 
	And far away into the sickly light, 
	From many a wondrous grot and secret cell 
	Unnumber'd and enormous polypi 
	Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green. 
	There hath he lain for ages and will lie 
	Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep, 
	Until the latter fire shall heat the deep; 
	Then once by man and angels to be seen, 
	In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die."
	   [ The Kraken, by Alfred, Lord Tennyson ]
*lady
	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various
	orifices had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of
	his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives.  She smiled.  This
	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.
	
	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.
	
	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,
	weally!"  With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens
	into the centre of the table.
	
	The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held
	it as steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three
	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.
	
	A six.  A three.  A five.
	
	Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the
	chance collision of several billion molecules, the die flipped
	onto a point, spun gently and came down a seven.  Blind Io
	picked up the cube and counted the sides.
	
	"Come _on_," he said wearily, "Play fair."
		[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
*lamp
	When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed,
	and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the
	garden, which were in reality precious stones.  He then asked
	for some food.
	
	"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I
	have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it."
	
	Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
	instead.  As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it
	might fetch a higher price.  Instantly a hideous genie
	appeared, and asked what she would have.  She fainted away,
	but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:
	"Fetch me something to eat!"

lance
	With this the wind increased, and the mill sails began to turn 
	about; which Don Quixote espying, said, 'Although thou movest
	more arms than the giant Briareus thou shalt stoop to me.'
	And, after saying this, and commending himself most devoutly
	to his Lady Dulcinea, desiring her to succor him in that trance,
	covering himself well with his buckler, and setting his lance
	on his rest, he spurred on Rozinante, and encountered with the
	first mill that was before him, and, striking his lance into
	the sail, the wind swung it about with such fury, that it broke
	his lance into shivers, carrying him and his horse after it,
	and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in 
	evil plight.

lava
* lava
	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
	out, cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the
	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving
	everything an eerie, macabre appearance. The air is filled with
	flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. The walls 
	are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out 
	all other sounds. Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are 
	myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which 
	scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls. To 
	one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured 
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself. An 
	immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, 
	burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit 
	far off to your left. To the right, an immense geyser of blistering 
	steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a
	sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. The far right wall is aflame
	with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal
	splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark, forboding passage 
	exits to the south.

lembas*
	In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender
	goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and
	brought them many gifts of food and clothing for their
	journey.  The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes,
	made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
	and inside was the colour of cream.  Gimli took up one of the
	cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.
	'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp
	corner and nibbled at it.  His expression quickly changed,
	and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
	'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing.  'You have
	eaten enough already for a long day's march.'
	'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen
	make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.
	'So it is,' they answered.  'But we call it lembas or
	waybread, and it is more strengthening than any foods made by
	Men, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts.'

lemure
larvae
	The Larvae (Lemures) are Roman spirits of deceased family members.
	These malignant spirits dwell throughout the house and frighten the
	inhabitants. People tried to reconcile or avert the Larvae with
	strange ceremonies which took place on May 9, 11, and 13; this
	was called the "Feast of the Lemures". The master of the house
	usually performed these ceremonies, either by offering black beans
	to the spirits or chasing them away by making a lot of noise. Their
	counterparts are the Lares, friendly and beneficent house spirits.

	The lemures fester at the very bottom of the scale of
	baatezu politics.  Again, many scholars seem reluctant
	to classify them as true baatezu, leaving them officially
	unranked and definitely unamed.  The lemures are the 
	mindless armies of the Blood War, the rank-and-file, 
	incapable of making decisions on their own.  They're
	driven into battle by threats of pain and destruction.
	However, as pathetic as they are, lemures are also the

leprechaun
	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

	Phaeton felt a rushing then, as if he were being pulled

	here was absolute, and the pressure on him immense.
	Something swam by him, and the elf recognized
	the creature again, grown somehow into immensity, and
	glowing eerily. It peered at him and spoke in his mind;
	the foundations of his sanity trembled. Somehow Phaeton
	could perceive that this was just an image, a shadow
	of something far greater; he saw in his mind's eye a
	creature encased in ice, frozen and unable to touch the
	world.
	
	Here you will forget. The creature seemed to swim
	lazily about him. But there is something you must yet do.
	
	What? Phaeton thought back.
	
	Don't you remember?
	
	A strange sensation burned in the elf's lungs, and
	recognition dawned.
	Oh, yes, he thought. I must breathe.

*lich
death knight
	Once in a great while, an evil master wizard or priest will
	manage through use of great magics to extend his or her life
	far beyond the normal span of a human. The usual effect of
	this is to transform the human, over time, into an undead of
	great magical power. A Lich hates life in any form; even a
	touch from one of these creatures will cause a numbing cold
	in the victim. They all possess the capability to use magic.
	
	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

lillend
	A lillend has the torso, arms, and head of a comely man or woman, 
	but also has broad, powerful, feathered wings and a stout 
	serpentine body from the waist downwards. Though the humanlike 
	portions of a lillend are of unremarkable hue, the feathered and 
	scaled parts of its anatomy are brightly colored and strikingly 
	patterned. Each individual has its own unique color combination 
	and is quite proud of it. A lillend wears no clothing but 
	sometimes wears jewelry. It always carries weapons and musical 
	instruments.
	
	Lillendi social status depends on a simple system of initiations 
	into mysteries and the ownership of certain totem masks. The 
	mysteries are akin to secret societies, and each mystery is a 
	specific kernel of wisdom passed on from one generation to the 
	next. The more societies a lillend is a member of, the greater 
	her status. Each society is devoted to particular musical forms, 
	songs, instruments, and weapons, so a group of lillendi usually 
	uses the same instruments, weaponry, and spells.

	The masks are tangentially related to the societies, since each 
	mask design belongs to a specific family, and long ago each 
	family lived in a single lodge and wore a single type of mask. 
	Things have gotten a little more complicated since then, but the 
	masks still roughly indicate status and family affiliations.

mother lilith
	Lilith was crafted by the Lords of Baator to haunt Prime 
	Material deserts, stealing children, corrupting men, and 
	recruiting witches to their cause. Thought to be older 
	than humanity, Lilith fulfilled her role across the 
	ages until it was feared she might become a goddess. 
	To prevent this from happening, she was bound to Count 
	Moloch, who became the Horned King to her Great Goddess.
	She viewed him with hatred, and thought fondly of the 
	kiss of the desert wind and her throngs of adoring 
	consorts and covens. 
	
	During the last Great Upheaval, while Beelzebub and his
	camp were busy with the war, she made her move. She 
	whispered to her lover that his greatest opportunities
	lay with supporting the Lord of the Flies. Asmodeus cast 
	him down, and made his consort ruler in his place.
	
	Moloch was sent away in disgrace, but Lilith was still 
	unsatisfied. She knew Asmodeus was watching her progress
	and feared that he had allowed her to retain the sixth 
	layer of Baator only because she was being groomed to be
	his bride. Knowing well what had happened to Bensozia, 
	Asmodeus' previous choice, she maneuvered to prevent this
	from happening.
	
	Secretly, she corrupted certain officials in Malsheem and
	managed to smuggle out a small quantity of the essence of
	Asmodeus and Benzozia to the yugoloths, with Glasya the

	"[...]  We'll succeed and you'll get all the fortune you came
	seeking."
	Jack shook his head dismally.  "You'll be better off without
	me," he said.  "I'm nothing but bad luck.  It's because I'm
	cursed.  A farmer I met on the way to the city cursed me.  He
	said, 'I curse you Jack.  May you never know wealth.  May all
	that you wish for be denied you.'"
	"What a horrid man," said Eddie.  "Why did he curse you like
	that?"
	Jack shrugged [...].  "Bad grace, I suppose.  Just because I
	shot off his ear and made him jump into a pit full of spikes."

lug
lugh
	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.
lurker*
	The lurker is a carnivorous scavenger found only in subterranean
	settings. It resembles a large manta ray; its grayish belly is
	textured like stone. The lurker typically attaches itself to a
	ceiling, where it is very difficult to detect (only 10% chance)
	unless actually prodded. ... Lurkers are opportunistic feeders
	that make do with whatever wanders by. The lurker flies by means
	of gases generated in sacs.

*were
	In 1573, the Parliament of Dole published a decree, permitting
	the inhabitants of the Franche-Comte to pursue and kill a
	were-wolf or loup-garou, which infested that province,
	"notwithstanding the existing laws concerning the chase."
	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little
	children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears,
	had as slight respect for ecclesiastical feasts as the French
	pig, which was not restrained by any feeling of piety from
	eating infants on a fast day.
		[ The History of Vampires, by Dudley Wright ]
lynx
	The animal proverbial for its piercing eyesight is a
	fabulous beast, half dog and half panther, but not like either
	in character. The cat-like animal now called a lynx is not
	remarkable for keen-sightedness. The word is probably related
	to Greek _lussein_, to see.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]
	
	To dream of seeing a lynx, enemies are undermining your
	business and disrupting your home affairs.  For a woman,
	this dream indicates that she has a wary woman rivaling her
	in the affections of her lover. If she kills the lynx, she
	will overcome her rival.

	This powerful mirror was created by Merlin, the druid, in ages

	carry it from magic missiles, and gives them ESP.

	  [...] In Dehenbarth (that now South Wales is hight,

	  The great magician Merlin had devised,
	  By his deep science, and hell-dreaded might,

	Whose virtues through the wide world soon were solemnized.
	
	It virtue had to show in perfect sight
	  Whatever thing was in the world contained,
	  Betwixt the lowest earth and heaven's height,
	  So that it to the looker appertained;
	  Whatever foe had wrought, or friend had fained,

	  Nor aught in secret from the same remained;
	  For-thy it round and hollow shaped was,

mammon
	The Viscount bowed low again as he accepted the
	silver piece. He beamed another huge smile at the Lord
	Minister and turned to leave. Almost as an afterthought,
	he turned back. "Tell me truly, Lord Minister. Will this
	gold you have gathered go to the one you serve?"
	
	The old man glared at the impertinence of the question,
	then seemed to think the better of it. "Yes, Viscount.
	It will go to His work. The aspects of His work which I
	see fit to place it towards."
	
	The Viscount beamed and bowed yet again. "One
	more indulgence, Gracious Father of Salvation. Could
	you read to me a page from your Holy Writ? I have
	always had a passion for hearing it spoken aloud. Any
	passage will do..."
	
	Almost snarling, the Lord Minister yanked the book
	from its chain and angrily opened it, tearing several
	pages in the process.
	
	"No man can serve two masters. Either he will hate
	the one and love the other, or he will be enslaved to one
	and betray the other. One cannot serve both God and
	Mammon."
	
	As the Lord Minister concluded the passage, the
	sound of a thousand golden coins falling to the ground
	resounded throughout the temple. The Viscount's smile,
	now framed by a red moustache and forked beard, became
	ugly as his teeth lengthened into golden fangs.

ma*annan*
	Normally called Manannan, Ler's son was the patron of

	feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan. Each section of the 
	manticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine 
	torso has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color,
	and the batlike wings are a dark brown with sparse hair. All 
	manticores have heads that resemble human males; the mane
	resembles a heavy beard and long hair.
	
	In combat, the manticore fires volleys of 1-6 tail spikes.
	The spikes are coated in a paralyzing venom.

	The marilith has a torso shaped like that of a human female,

	Medusa, one of the three Gorgons or Graeae, is the only one
	of her sisters to have assumed mortal form and inhabited the

	When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the
	conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
	country.  She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her
	chief glory, but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva,
	the goddess deprived her of her charms and changed her
	beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.  She became a cruel
	monster of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could
	behold her without being turned into stone.  All around the
	cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men
	and animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and
	had been petrified with the sight.  Perseus, favoured by
	Minerva and Mercury, the former of whom lent him her shield
	and the latter his winged shoes, approached Medusa while she
	slept and taking care not to look directly at her, but guided
	by her image reflected in the bright shield which he bore, he
	cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the
	middle of her Aegis.

	Metroids appear to be able to sense the life energy of their

	In their natural life cycle, Metroids gradually metamorphose
	to take a somewhat reptilian form, growing a hard organic 
	shell, a head, and limbs, eventually shedding their gelatinous
	membrane completely. The shell removes their weakness to cold

	Also known as the Fungi from Yuggoth, the Mi-go are parasitic
	fungoid entities which inhabit pinkish, crustacean-like
	creatures.  These creatures are the size of a man, and their

	would normally be sits a convoluted ellipsoid, which in turn
	sprouts innumerable antennae: the true body of the
	parasite pushing through the cracked shell of its host. The
	hosts are about 5 feet (1.5 m) long, and their crustacean-
	like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They 
	also possess a pair of membranous wings which are used to fly
	through the thin aether of outer space.

	comes to experimental fodder.  Under normal circumstances a
	Philosopher will take its time while removing a brain
	-ensuring that the brain remains fully functional- but if it

	I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to 
	come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless 
	to act, my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, 
	so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I 
	slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me 
	that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the 
	clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was 
	dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, 
	but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through 
	the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into 
	the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window 
	before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain 
	on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs 
	and even my will. I lay still and endured, that was all. I 
	closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It 
	is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how 
	conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker 
	and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like 
	smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, 
	not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. 
	It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became 
	concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, 
	through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining 
	like a red eye.

	What does it mean to fight for the Balance? How is one a part 
	of it, how does it make its way through all things?
	
	Balance is the quest for equilibrium, the movement of all 
	things to the center. If the center cannot hold...that is the
	fear, that the Spire is the foundation that all others 
	foolishly seek to crack and topple in their careless pursuit
	of malice and charity, freedom and constraint.
	
	Yes. But more -- what is the identity of Balance? Its face?
	Who is that face, and what is its identity?
	
	The identity of Balance is its citizens and its guardians. 
	Its citizens are those who are neither too cruel nor too 
	kind. Its guardians however must kill and save innocents, 
	must be selfish and charitable in equal quantities. The face
	of Balance is the rilmani, the guardians. They are forever 
	walking the line, ever seeking to keep themselves in 
	equilibrium. Who they are is this walking, this act of 
	treading upon the thinnest of strands.

	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.

*mithril*
	_Mithril_!  All folk desired it.  It could be beaten like
	copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make
	of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel.
	Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty
	of _mithril_ did not tarnish or grow dim.

*mitre of holiness
	This helm of brilliance performs all of the normal functions
	of a helm of brilliance, but also has the ability to protect
	anyone who carries it from fire.  When invoked, it boosts
	the energy of the invoker, allowing them to cast more spells.
mjollnir
	Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's
	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,
	destruction, and resurrection.

	And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

	he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that
	sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech;
	he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall
	stone him with stones.
	And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
	from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
	Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes
	from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill
	him not:
	Then I will set my face against that man, and against his

* monk

master kaen
	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".
	
	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"
	
	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."
	
	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"
	
	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.
	
	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

morning star
	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but
	with a large spike on the end and smaller spikes around the
	circumference. It was also known as the goedendag (from the
	Dutch word for "good day") and the holy water sprinkler (from its
	resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the Catholic Mass).
	It was used by both cavalry and infantry; the horseman's weapon
	typically had a shorter haft than the footman's, which might be up
	to six feet long. It came into use in the beginning of the 14th
	century.
	The name "morning star" is often erroneously applied to the

	but with the head attached by a short chain.

	above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
	that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
	lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black

	Any weapon wielded by a movanic deva is further enhanced by the 
	deva's fiery aura. Movanic devas are the most privileged of all

	the weapon may be stunned by the force behind the blows. Astral 
	devas attend to matters in the Lower Planes for the powers of 
	good. These powerful, pure warriors can pass into the Lower 
	Planes at will, bringing their justice to the heart of evil. If 
	directly commanded by the power they serve, they can enter any 
	layer of any lower plane without passing through intermediate 
	layers. Astral devas also commonly travel to the Astral Plane to 
	rescue good-aligned mortals who have become lost or stranded.

	Shiva (Sanskrit: Siva, meaning "The Auspicious One"; 
	Tamil: Sivan, meaning "The Red One"), also known as 
	Mahadeva ("Great God"), is one of the three deities of 
	Hinduism. Shiva is distinct from Vishnu and Brahman yet 
	one with them. He is "Anant" [Who is neither found born 
	nor found dead]. At the highest level, Shiva is regarded 
	as limitless, transcendent, unchanging and formless. 
	Shiva also has many benevolent and fearsome forms. In 
	benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient Yogi 
	who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash, as well as a 
	householder with wife Parvati and his two children, 
	Ganesha and Kartikeya, and in fierce aspects, he is often 
	depicted slaying demons.

naginata
	A Japanese pole-arm, fitted with a curved single-edged blade.
	The blades ranged in length from two to four feet, mounted on
	shafts about four to five feet long.  The naginata were cut
	with a series of short grooves near to the tang, above which
	the back edge was thinned, but not sharpened, so that the
	greater part of the blade was a flattened diamond shape in
	section.  Seen in profile, the curve is slight or non-
	existent near the tang, becoming more pronounced towards the
	point.
	
	"With his naginata he killed five, but with the sixth it
	snapped asunder in the midst and, flinging it away, he drew
	his sword, wielding it in the zigzag style, the interlacing,
	cross, reversed dragonfly, waterwheel, and eight-sides-at-
	once styles of fencing and cutting down eight men; but as he
	brought down the ninth with a mighty blow on the helmet, the
	blade snapped at the hilt."

	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim

	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.

	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
offler
	Offler hesitated. He was a very old god, who had arisen from
	steaming swamps in hot, dark lands. He had survived the rise
	and fall of more modern and certainly more beautiful gods by
	developing, for a god, a certain amount of wisdom.
	
	Besides, Nuggan was one of the newer gods, all full of 
	hellfire and self-importance and _ambition_. Offler was not
	bright, but he had some vague inkling that for long-term 
	survival gods needed to offer their worshippers something
	more than a mere lack of thunderbolts. And he felt an 
	ungodlike pang of sympathy for any human whose god banned
	chocolate _and_ garlic.
		[ The Last Hero, by Terry Pratchett ]
	
	'It's _you_, isn't it?' he growled. 'You're Nuggan, aren't 
	you?'
	'You utter, utter...fifteen years! Fifteen damn years before
	I ever tasted garlic! And the priests used to get up early
	in the countryside round us to jump on all the mushrooms!
	And do you know how _much_ a small slab of chocolate cost
	in our town, and what they did to people who were caught with
	one?' The minstrel shouldered the Horde aside and advanced
	on the retreating god, his lyre raised like a club.
	
	'Broccoli,' murmured Offler to Sweevo, God of Cut Timbur,
	'You can't go wrong with broccoli.'

ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

	During our watches below we overhauled our clothes, and made

	But at the end of the Third Age a troll-race not before seen
	appeared in southern Mirkwood and in the mountain borders of

	known.  Some held that they were not Trolls but giant Orcs;
	but the Olog-hai were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike
	even the largest of Orc-kind, whom they far surpassed in size
	and power.  Trolls they were, but filled with the evil will
	of their master:  a fell race, strong, agile, fierce and
	cunning, but harder than stone.  Unlike the older race of the

	What was the fruit like?  Unfortunately, no one can describe

	the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and the

	and woody, and the sweetest wild strawberry was sour.  And
	there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps.  If you had once
	eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would
	taste like medicines after it.  But I can't describe it.  You
	can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that

phantom fungus
	A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the
	vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in
	search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along
	the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its
	mouth to pinpoint prey.
	
	The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with
	row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks
	more than actual fangs. This "mouth" is not used to feed, however,
	and does not attach to a digestive tract—it is nothing more than
	a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so
	by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with
	thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to
	siphon away nutrients.
		[ Pathfinder RPG ]
phase spider
	Sometimes confused with neogi or driders and called planar
	spiders on some worlds of the Prime, phase spiders are intelligent
	web-spinners with a raised thorax and a humanlike
	head. What really makes phase spiders stand out is their
	enviable ability to phase back and forth between a plane and
	the plane's Border.
	
	Unknown to most creatures, phase spiders possess
	large web habitats on the Ethereal (both in the Deep and on
	the Border) and only appear on other planes while hunting
	for food. Some phase spiders do live mostly on material
	planes, but these spiders are the exception, not the rule. Like
	many more familiar cultures, Ethereally-based phase spiders
	are not a cohesive race, but instead exist in separate clutches
	(tribes), each of which claims various Prime territories as its
	sole hunting ground. Sometimes disparate phase spider
	clutches cooperate, but sometimes they come into conflict
	over temtorial disputes.

	I bolted. But it was no cockatrice! I felt a sudden intense 
	searing of the skin around my face, and flames began to leap

	Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not

sirius
	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a

	through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
	walking on its surface.
	
	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many
	tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears

orpheus
	Orpheus is a legendary figure, described by most ancient
	sources as Thracian, and venerated throughout the ancient
	Hellenised world as a heroic, civilising benefactor to
	mankind. [...] Pindar calls Orpheus "the father of songs"
	and asserts him as a son of the Thracian king Oeagrus and
	the Muse Calliope.
	[...]
	The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of
	his wife Eurydice (also known as Agriope). [...] Eurydice
	fell into a nest of vipers and she suffered a fatal bite
	on her heel.  Her body was discovered by Orpheus who,
	overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs
	that all the nymphs and gods wept.  On their advice, Orpheus
	traveled to the underworld and by his music softened the
	hearts of Hades and Persephone (he was the only person ever
	to do so), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him
	to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her
	and not look back until they both had reached the upper
	world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his
	anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to
	look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper
	world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.

	The pentagram was probably discovered as a result of

	around 4000 B.C. It was a common sign among the Sumerians around
	2700 B.C. Some of those who have conducted research of symbols
	believe the pentagram was used by the Sumerians as a cosmic 
	symbol representing the four corners of the earth and the vault
	of the heavens. This, however, seems a bit far-fetched. 
	
	After the Sumerian time there is no clear evidence as to what 
	the pentagram might have meant until the sign appears in 
	Pythagorean mysticism, where it represents Hugieia ("health")
	and the five hidden cavities.
	
	The pentagram also symbolizes the five elements, and authority
	over the same. King Solomon was given a ring with a pentagram

poseido*n
	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and
	fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus,
	Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter.  His rank of ruler of the
	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
	earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
	powerful ruler, every inch a king.

	POTABLE, n.  Suitable for drinking.  Water is said to be

	from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it
	is a medicine.  Upon nothing has so great and diligent
	ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all
	countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the
	invention of substitutes for water.  To hold that this

	in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must be
	able to bounce off it a photon of radiation; this act of
	location itself alters the position of the particle
	in an unpredictable way. To locate the position accurately,
	photons of short wavelength would have to be used. The high
	momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the
	position. On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta
	would have less effect on the particle's position, but would
	be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.

	pressure from it or the secondary projections to either break the

rust monster
	Rust monsters are subterranean creatures with an appetite for
	all sorts of metals. These unique creatures, though generally
	inoffensive, are the bane of fighters everywhere. 
	The average rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high
	at the shoulder. It has a strange tail that appears armor plated
	and ends in an odd-looking bony projection that resembles a 
	double-ended paddle. Two prehensile antennae are located under
	the thing's two eyes. The hide of the rust monster is rough,
	covered with lumpy projections. Coloration varies from a 
	yellowish tan on the underside and legs, to a rust red upper
	back. Rust monsters smell like wet, oxidized metal.

sandestin
	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.
	
	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep
	in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
		[...]
	"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this
	was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"
	
	"And my indenture point?"
	
	"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"
	
	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."
	
	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"
	
	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at
	the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance,
	though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put
	such things inside myself, I might well become uneasy."

sasquatch
	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

	either one or two short handles at right angles to it – 
	usually one near the upper end and always another roughly 
	in the middle. A long, curved blade about 60 to 90 centimetres
	(24 to 35 in)) long is mounted at the lower end, perpendicular
	to the snaith.

	there are no typical serpent features such as scales,

	It has been suggested that in Ancient Egyptian art the

shopkeeper
	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are generically
	known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear. Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark 
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets. And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale, the
	wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-volume
	novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in 
	common. They explain the observed facts, and they are completely
	and utterly wrong.

	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle in
	which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from above, and
	tries to put them in designated locations. Only one box may be pushed
	at a time, not two, and boxes cannot be pulled. As the puzzle would
	be extremely difficult to create physically, it is usually implemented
	as a video game.
	
	Sokoban was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was published
	by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan. Thinking
	Rabbit also released three sequels: Boxxle, Sokoban Perfect and Sokoban
	Revenge.

	The soldiers of Yendor are well-trained in the art of war,
	many trained by the Wizard himself.  Some say the soldiers
	are explorers who were unfortunate enough to be captured,
	and put under the Wizard's spell.  Those who have survived
	encounters with soldiers say they travel together in platoons,
	and are fierce fighters.  Because of the load of their combat
	gear, however, one can usually run away from them, and doing
	so is considered a wise thing.
son of Typhon
	First [Herakles] was assigned to fetch the skin of the 
	Nemeian lion, an invulnerable animal sired by Typhon . . .
	He then went to Nemea, found the lion, and shot it first with 
	arrows. But when he knew for sure it was invulnerable, he 
	picked up his club and started after it. 
	It escaped into a double-mouthed cave, but Herakles blocked 
	up one of the mouths, and ran in after the creature through 
	the other. He encircled its neck with his arm, and by squeezing 
	choked it to death.

	The Book of Three lay closed on the table.  Taran had never

	had been stung by hornets.  He jumped back, stumbled against

spell
	A spell is a consciously directed act of magic which may take
	almost any form, depending on the laws of magic in operation.
	Commonly there will be a spoken element, ranging from a simple 
	phrase or name to elaborately complex ritual incantations. 
	[...]  Hand-gestures or passes may be required -- called 
	the "somatic element" by the scientific magic investigators 
	in L. Sprague de Camp's and Fletcher Pratt's _Incomplete
	Enchanter_ series.
	Many spells exhaust the caster, like Gorice's arduous conjuration
	in _The Worm Ouroboros_ (1922) by E. R. Eddison.  Jack Vance's 
	_The Dying Earth_ (1950) has spells which must be painstakingly 
	impressed on the mind (whose capacity is finite), and when cast 
	are gone until re-learned.

spire
	"Long ago a silver queen emerged from the Hinterlands below, 
	having followed the path of the great pillar, Axis Mundi, 
	that extended deep into the earth. She had come to see the 
	top of this edifice, and perhaps learn who had built the 
	foundation of her underground realm. Yet when she emerged 
	with her eight children--four sons and four daughters--she 
	saw that the Spire extended far into the sky. Eight great 
	roads extended out from the monument to Mystery, veering and 
	branching into sixteen paths that crossed and diverted, 
	shifting like living streams.
	
	While her children stared off into the distance, the queen 
	herself looked up into the sky. In the distance she saw that 
	infinity might have an end, a height that might be ascended 
	to. Her children felt the same way about the roads that ran 
	to embrace the horizon. Together they realized they might 
	walk and climb and thereby measure the Wheel, squaring the 
	circle at last.
	
	To each son and each daughter was given a blade, to keep them 
	safe on their journeys. And so the children each picked a 
	road and began walking, choosing different forks and turns, 
	getting lost but always finding themselves once more. 
	Meanwhile, the silver queen began to climb. She was 
	determined to reach the top of the Spire, for it was there 
	that she might watch for her children as she waited for their 
	return."

	A droven punishment form combining the worst aspects of humanoids

	limbs of a spider. This form is typically inflicted on drow 
	novices who see spiders as holy creatures worthy of worship, 
	rather than as allegories and useful tools. It may also be 
	inflicted on young drow who boast about their cunning to others.
	Unlike driders, sprow are too weak to survive alone and are not 
	driven out of the droven cities, instead being used as

	So they stood, each in his place, neither moving a finger's
	breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given
	and received by each in that time, till here and there were
	sore bones and bumps, yet neither thought of crying "Enough,"
	or seemed likely to fall from off the bridge.  Now and then
	they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen
	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his
	jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd
	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but
	the stranger warded the blow, and once again thwacked Robin,
	and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the
	water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.

	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"

	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund

	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever

	He landed and dismounted beside one of the plants. The plant stood
	a foot high on a knobbly green stalk. Its single blossom was as big
	as a large man's face. The back of that blossom was stringy, as if
	laced with veins or tendons; and the inner surface was a smooth
	concave mirror. From its center protruded a short stalk ending in
	a dark green bulb.

	A soul-cutting sword that is advanced to Bankai (Final
	Release) typically gains the ability to project some large,
	flashy effect, or to manifest a massive creature to do battle
	for its master. Not so Zangetsu. Instead, its final form,
	Tensa Zangetsu (Heaven-chain Slaying Moon), focuses all its
	power into the form of a normal daito sword. The shear 
	intensity of the energies within this sword make the blade
	almost impervious to damage, allowing it to parry a wide 
	variety of effects. The blade can additionally create a
	protective field around its wielder in the form of a cloak
	or long coat. Tensa Zangetsu may also be invoked to fire a
	powerful energy blast known as a Getsuga Tenso (Heaven-
	Piercing Moon-Fang) which can cleave through enemies and
	obstructing terain alike. Finally, the compressed forces
	at play in Tensa Zangetsu greatly affect the wielder's 
	sense of time, allowing them to move and attack much faster 
	than they otherwise could. The immense pressures acting on 
	the blade, however, are far beyond what a mortal can endure.
	Any living creature that wields this sword will find their

* tourist
	The road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and
	winding, a thirty-league stretch of potholes and half-buried
	rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green
	valleys of citrus trees, crosses liana-webbed gorges on
	creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than
	useful.
	Picturesque.  That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard
	(BMgc, Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number
	he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of
	Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.  Picturesque meant --
	he decided after careful observation of the scenery that
	inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was
	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the
	occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-
	ridden and tumbledown.
	Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld.
	Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant "idiot".

towel
	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say
	on the subject of towels.
	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
	practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as
	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

*tower
*tower of darkness
	Towers (_brooding_, _dark_) stand alone in Waste Areas and
	almost always belong to Wizards.  All are several stories high,
	round, doorless, virtually windowless, and composed of smooth
	blocks of masonry that make them very hard to climb. [...]
	You will have to go to a Tower and then break into it at some
	point towards the end of your Tour.

	I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping
	into his house.  I knew what he had made of a certain palace at
	Mazenderan.  From being the most honest building conceivable, he

	not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo.
	With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless
	tragedies of all kinds.

trapper or lurker above
	The trapper is a creature which has evolved a chameleon-like
	ability to blend into the dungeon surroundings.  It captures
	its prey by remaining very still and blending into the
	surrounding dungeon features, until an unsuspecting creature
	passes by.  It wraps itself around its prey and digests it.
tree
	I think that I shall never see
	A poem lovely as a tree.
	A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
	Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
	A tree that looks at God all day,
	And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
	A tree that may in Summer wear
	A nest of robins in her hair;
	Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
	Who intimately lives with rain.
	Poems are made by fools like me,
	But only God can make a tree.

tripe
tripe ration
	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.

*troll
	The troll shambled closer.  He was perhaps eight feet tall,
	perhaps more.  His forward stoop, with arms dangling past
	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.
	He clambered back on his feet and grinned at them.  The
	waning faggot cast red light over his fangs.

	The tsurugi, also known as the long samurai sword, is an
	extremely sharp, two-handed blade favored by the samurai.

	rumored to be so sharp that it can occasionally cut

*twin gear*spirit*
	The Clockwork Perfection of Mechanus is driven by great 
	gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run 
	smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits."
	These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves 
	into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even 
	crossbows. This dual crossbow is actually two gear spirits,
	and they seem to have willingly fled with from Mechanus.
	
    Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of 
	Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these 
	spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love 
	the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons 
	rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a 
	result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the 
	great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while 
	to sample the Planes beyond their own. Most likely, these 
	two spirits caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback 
	along with you, peppering any hostile creature they see 
	with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless 
	supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for 
	to reload unless you wish to fire special crossbow bolts. 
	
    The spirits occasionally make small clicking and rattling 
	noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their 
	conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely 
	discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.

	"Rincewind!"
	Twoflower sprang off the bed.  The wizard jumped back,
	wrenching his features into a smile.
	"My dear chap, right on time!  We'll just have lunch, and
	then I'm sure you've got a wonderful programme lined up for
	this afternoon!"
	"Er --"
	"That's great!"
	Rincewind took a deep breath.  "Look," he said desperately,
	"let's eat somewhere else.  There's been a bit of a fight
	down below."
	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"
	"Well, you see, I - _what_?"
	"I thought I made myself clear this morning, Rincewind.  I
	want to see genuine Morporkian life - the slave market, the
	Whore Pits, the Temple of Small Gods, the Beggar's Guild...
	and a genuine tavern brawl."  A faint note of suspicion
	entered Twoflower's voice.  "You _do_ have them, don't you?
	You know, people swinging on chandeliers, swordfights over
	the table, the sort of thing Hrun the Barbarian and the
	Weasel are always getting involved in.  You know --

tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.

*hulk
	Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose
	iron-like claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in
	search of prey.  They are tremendously strong; muscles bulge
	beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and
	legs all end in great claws.
*unicorn
unicorn horn
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
	[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.
	"You hold your beer awfully well."
	Tlingel laughed.  "A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its
	possession is a universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the
	warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and
	keep me right there."

	Above all moons made dark and riven,
	Hold up its foaming head in heaven,

	Strange creatures with long, claw-tipped tentacles in place

	a gross anthropomorphism, if not an outright falsehood.
	The merest glipse of their form drives men mad, and they

	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her

	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the

	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling

	at once!"

	The monkey king said to the horrible monster, "Are you the water
	demon who owns this pond?" "Yes, I am," said he. "Do you eat whoever
	goes into the water?" asked the king. "Yes, I do," he answered,
	"including even birds. I eat them all. And when you are forced by your
	thirst to come into the pond and drink, I will enjoy eating you, the
	biggest monkey, most of all!" He grinned, and saliva dripped down his
	hairy chin.

*water walking*
	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto
	thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out
	of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw
	the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
	saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand,
	and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
	didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

web
	I watch her in the corner there, 
	As, restless, bold, and unafraid, 
	She slips and floats along the air 
	Till all her subtile house is made

	Her home, her bed, her daily food 
	All from that hidden store she draws; 
	She fashions it and knows it good, 
	By instinct's strong and sacred laws. 

	No tenuous threads to weave her nest, 
	She seeks and gathers there or here; 
	But spins it from her faithful breast, 
	Renewing still, till leaves are sere. 

	Then, worn with toil, and tired of life, 
	In vain her shining traps are set. 
	Her frost hath hushed the insect strife 
	And gilded flies her charm forget. 

	But swinging in the snares she spun, 
	She sways to every winter wind: 
	Her joy, her toil, her errand done, 
	Her corse the sport of storms unkind.
		[ Arachne, by Rose Terry Cooke ]

	Oh what a tangled web we weave,
	When first we practise to deceive!
		[ Marmion, by Sir Walter Scott ]
weeping *angel
	Lonely assassins they used to be called. No one quite knows
	where they came from, but they're as old as the universe. Or
	very nearly, and they have survived this long because they
	have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're
	quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed,
	in the moment they are seen by any other living creature
	they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact that their
	biology, in the sight of any other living thing they literally
	turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course a stone
	can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away.
	Then you blink. And oh yes it can.
		[ Doctor Who, "Blink" ]
	
	"This whole book, it's a warning about the weeping angels, so
	why no pictures? Why not show us what to look out for?"
	"There was a bit about images. What was that?"
	"Yes. Hang on.... 'That which holds the image of an angel
	becomes itself an angel.'"
		[ Doctor Who, "The Time of Angels" ]
whistle
	There were legends both on the front and on the back of the 
	whistle. The one read thus:

	FLA FUR BIS FLE The other: QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT 
	'I ought to be able to make it out,' he thought; 
	'but I suppose I am a little rusty in my Latin. 
	When I come to think of it, I don't believe I even 
	know the word for a whistle. The long one does seem 
	simple enough. It ought to mean, "Who is this who is coming?" 

	Well, the best way to find out is evidently to whistle 
	for him.'

*wight
	A wight is a fearsome undead spirit inhabiting the remains of a
	deceased humanoid. Due to their corporeal nature, wights are able
	to make use of both weapons and magic.

	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.

	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.

rodney
wizard of yendor
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!

	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are

	down prey.
*wolfsbane
	1.  Any of various, usually poisonous perennial herbs of the
	genus Aconitum, having tuberous roots, palmately lobed leaves,
	blue or white flowers with large hoodlike upper sepals, and an
	aggregate of follicles.  2.  The dried leaves and roots of some
	of these plants, which yield a poisonous alkaloid that was
	formerly used medicinally. In both senses also called monkshood.

	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.

worm
long worm
long worm tail
	  Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty metres away at the foot of a
	rock beach, a silver-gray curve broached from the desert, sending
	rivers of sand and dust cascading all around. It lifted higher,
	resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round, black hole
	with edges glistening in the moonlight.
	  The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica
	huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from
	crystal teeth.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
worm that walks
	"The nethermost caverns," wrote the mad Arab, "are not for the 
	fathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and 
	terrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and 
	oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely 
	did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard 
	hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all 
	ashes. For it is of old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought 
	hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the 
	very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life 
	springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it 
	and swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are 
	digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have 
	learnt to walk that ought to crawl."
		[ The Festival, by HP Lovecraft ]
worm tooth
crysknife
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
wraith
	The wraith is an evil undead spirit of a powerful human that seeks
	to absorb human life energy. 
	These horrible creatures are usually seen as black, vaguely man-shaped
	clouds. They have no true substance, but tend to shape themselves with
	two upper limbs, a torso, and a head with two glowing red eyes. This
	shape is a convenience born from the habit of once having a human body. 
		[ Monstrous Manual, by TSR inc. ]
*wumpus
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump (6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]
	
	_Wumpus yobgregorii_, in the flesh...

xan
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.

xorn
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
ya
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
yeenoghu
	This gaunt, 12-foot tall humanoid demon is covered with
	mangy patches of yellow fur and has pale grey flesh
	showing where the fur is absent. His face is that of
	a leering, amber-eyed hyena, and he wields a massive
	flail with three spiked heads.
		[ Hordes of the Abyss,
			by Ed Stark, James Jacobs, and Erik Mona ]

	Yeenoghu, demon lord of gnolls. He casts magic projectiles 
	at those close to him, and a mere glance into his piercing 
	eyes may hopelessly confuse the battle-weary adventurer.
yeti
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
*yugake
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
yumi
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
*zombi*
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is

	This foul demoness resembles a human only from the torso
	up. This portion of her body is composed of thick rancid
	sheets and coils of fungus that just happens to have grown
	into the shape of what would otherwise be an attractive
	woman. Four fibrous antlers grow from her brow, and her
	hands bear cruel talons. Her lower torso is a coiling
	pillar of lashing ropy tendrals and other fungus growths.
	Her skin is a nauseating swirl of grays, blues, purples,
	and blacks.
