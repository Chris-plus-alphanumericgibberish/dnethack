abbot
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

armour*
suit or piece of armor
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another 
	boy and me. He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his 
	mother had made him from her hair. I, on the other hand, had 
	a brand new suit of chain mail. Just before our joust, I asked 
	him what he'd do if he made the team. (I was hoping to be more 
	popular with the ladies.) He said he would be able to save the 
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20 
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me. I insisted we swap 
	armor. He was forced to accept, as it would have been an 
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected 
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor 
	class was that day."

aclys
aglaope
siren
	In Greek mythology, the Sirens were three dangerous bird-women, 
	portrayed as seductresses who lured nearby sailors with their 
	enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of 
	their island. [...] In some later, rationalized traditions, the
	literal geography of the "flowery" island of Anthemoessa, or 
	Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in 
	the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.
	All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

	Their number is variously reported as between two and five. 
	In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, 
	but gives the number of the Sirens as two.  Later writers mention
	both their names and number: some state that there were three, 
	Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia or Parthenope, Ligeia, and 
	Leucosia.

	is... moving? Something's stealing the light away!
	
	It's almost as though the light turns into twinkling sand
	and flows toward the back of the cavern, like grains falling
	through an hourglass. But at a certain point, the particles
	of light disappear, as though somehow consumed.

	little globe of pallid light.  Now as he came near, it was
	tinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the
	surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of
	his torch.  At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his
	breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner
	light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug

*shikaga *akauji
	Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
	joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
	government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
	governments was known as the Nambokucho.
	[ Samurai - The Story of a Warrior Tradition, by Cook ]
	
	On July 8, 1336,  he and his samurai entered Kyoto, forced Go-Daigo
	to retire,  after which  he seized  power himself  and installed  a
	puppet prince on the throne  (the current Japanese  imperial family
	are  the   descendants  of  this   puppet  emperor  that   Ashikaga
	installed).
	
	Go-Daigo escaped,  though, wouldn't  admit to  have been  defeated,
	and  opened a new "capital"  in Yoshino (south of  Kyoto), where he
	and few  of his  descendants claimed  to be  running a  government,
	known as  the "Southern Court". The  period between  1337 and 1392,
	when Japan was ruled by two courts, is known as the Nambokucho.
	
	That "government" disappeared, naturally, after a  few generations,
	and Ashikaga's  Muromachi regime lasted for  a long  time. The last
	Ashikaga daimyo in power was the 14th descendant of Takauji.

	Seated upon the Serpent's Throne He looked at me. He looked 
	at me as I sat in what I thought was safety!
	
	The small amount of exposed flesh was flawless, like the 
	purest marble. His attire was like the robes and cloaks of 
	a holy high priest, both regal yet simple in its austerity.
	It did not seem woven from any fabric in this or any other 
	world, but spun from the blackness of the Cosmos itself. In
	the long fingers that rested in his lap He held a ruby 
	scepter, its head an onyx pentagram. For all of this, what 
	I remember more than anything were the eyes. They were large 
	under the heavy brow. Completely red, like blood, those 
	glowing eyes gazed at me. Through me. Into and beyond my soul. 
	They devoured everything I ever was and could be. Despite the 
	pleasant smile on His face, those eyes told me I was less than
	nothing, an object to be used and discarded as necessary.

	Baator itself. She's a very skilled diplomat and tactician, and 
	an unmatched sorceress. She has created many artifacts and 
	techniques used throughout the Nine Hells. In addition to her 
	status, this fact granted her a deep respect from almost everyone
	in Baator, even from Asmodeus, who appreciates her to the point 
	of letting her live with her ever-scheming consort.
	
	Knowing all too well her master's position, Baalphegor keeps her 
	goals to herself, acting with a minimal degree of loyalty to the 
	Lord of the Eighth. Mephistopheles tolerates this due to the 
	protection given by his consort's presence.

bear trap
	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap. It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle. When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place. Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place. The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape. More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff. They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

	The tissue injury resulting from frostbite is produced in two ways. The most 
	obvious is actual freezing of the tissues. Although ice crystals form between 
	the cells and grow by extracting water from them, the cells are physically 
	disrupted by the ice crystals only to a limited extent. The dehydration and 
	osmotic and chemical imbalances resulting from  extraction of water from within 
	the cell injure them, but permanent damage may be small. (...) The second 
	mechanism of tissue injury by frostbite, which is much more significant is loss
	of blood supply to the tissues. Blood may flow through larger vessels but (one 
	of the signs of adequate rewarming is a flushing of the frozen area) oxygen 
	cannot be deliver to the tissues because the small blood vessels that would 
	carry it have been lost.

	yellow brown  and their  thick coarse  hair varies  in colour  from

candle of invocation
	A magical candle that can be invoked while lit to open an
	extra-planar gate. Said gate lasts only seconds once opened,
	allowing for a single creature to pass through. The best-known
	use for this gate is to seek audience from an angelic being,
	though rumors exist of fools chasing their hearts' desires
	or disturbing storied demons from their fortresses.
candy bar
	Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever
	get to taste a bit of chocolate.  The whole family saved up
	their money for that special occasion, and when the great
	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

carmilla
	She was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that
	her movements were languid-very languid-indeed, there 
	was nothing in her appearance to indicate an invalid. 
	Her complexion was rich and brilliant; her features were 
	small and beautifully formed; her eyes large, dark, and 
	lustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw hair 
	so magnificently thick and long when it was down about her 
	shoulders; I have often placed my hands under it, 
	and laughed with wonder at its weight. It was exquisitely 
	fine and soft, and in color a rich very dark brown, with 
	something of gold. I loved to let it down, tumbling with 
	its own weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her chair 
	talking in her sweet low voice, I used to fold and braid 
	it, and spread it out and play with it. 
	
	Heavens! If I had but known all!

carrot
	In World War II, Britain's air ministry spread the word that a diet of
	these vegetables helped pilots see Nazi bombers attacking at night. That
	was a lie intended to cover the real matter of what was underpinning the
	Royal Air Force's successes: Airborne Interception Radar, also known as
	AI. ... British Intelligence didn't want the Germans to find out
	about the superior new technology helping protect the nation, so they
	created a rumor to afford a somewhat plausible-sounding explanation
	for the sudden increase in bombers being shot down. ...
	The disinformation was so persuasive that the English public took to
	eating carrots to help them find their way during the blackouts.

*cat lord
	Elder Goddess of cats, earthly knowledge of the true name 
	and nature of this being was already becoming confused by
	the time of ancient Egypt. It is believed that the Cat Lord
	entered into some pact or covenant with the rulers of this 
	early nation. However, the terms of this agreement, down to 
	the correct pronunciation of the unprecidented hieroglyphs 
	found in the being's name, have long since been lost, though
	the goddesses _Bastet_ and _Sekhmet_ are believed to be 
	descended from the stories surrounding the Cat Lord and its
	agreement.
	
	The hieroglyphs enclosed within its cartouche are drawn with
	variable numbers of strokes, though no glyph requires more
	than seven strokes to draw. The fourth and fifth and the
	eight and ninth hieroglyphs are smaller than the average,
	but must be drawn as pairs. The completed cartouche contains
	nine hieroglyphs.
s*d*g*r* cat
	Imagine a sealed container, so perfectly constructed that no
	physical influence can pass either inwards or outwards across its
	walls.  Imagine that inside the container is a cat, and also a
	device that can be triggered by some quantum event.  If that event
	takes place, then the device smashes a phial containing cyanide and
	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the
	decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat
	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably
	protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector
	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's
	linear combination has no relevance.

	Now it was light enough to leave.  Moon-Watcher picked up
	the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent
	under the low overhang of the cave.  Once outside, he
	threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright - the
	only animal in all this world able to do so.
	Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant.  He was
	nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished
	weighed over a hundred pounds.  His hairy, muscular body
	was halfway between ape and man, but his head was already
	much nearer to man than ape.  The forehead was low, and
	there were ridges over the eye sockets, yet he unmistakably
	held in his genes the promise of humanity.

	'Twas in a land unkempt of life's red dawn;

	By night stole forth and slew the savage boar, 
	So that he loomed a hunter of loud fame, 
	And many a skin of wolf and wild-cat wore, 
	And counted many a flint-head to his name; 
	Wherefore he walked the envy of the band, 
	Hated and feared, but matchless in his skill. 
	Till lo! one night deep in that shaggy land, 
	He tracked a yearling bear and made his kill;

	And sank into a sleep too deep for dream.

*centaur
	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	reddish bodies and blue legs; great myriapedes are seen
	crawling every where.  Although they do no harm, they excite
	in man a feeling of loathing.  Perhaps our appearance
	produces a similar feeling in the elephant and other large

	Cerberus, (or Kerberos in Greek), was the three-headed dog
	that guarded the Gates of Hell.  He allowed any dead to enter,
	and likewise prevented them all from ever leaving.  He was

	playing bewitching music on his lyre, and the other time when
	Hercules confronted him and took him to the world of the

	A small lizard perched on a brown stone.  Feeling threatened by

	Dantes rapidly cleared away the earth around the chest.  Soon
	the center lock appeared, then the handles at each end, all
	delicately wrought in the manner of that period when art made
	precious even the basest of metals.  He took the chest by the
	two handles and tried to lift it, but it was impossible.  He
	tried to open it; it was locked.  He inserted the sharp end
	of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and pushed down
	on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
	Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his
	gun and placed it beside him.  Then he closed his eyes like a
	child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
	The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
	were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold
	ingots packed in orderly stacks.  From the third compartment,
	which was half full, Dantes picked up handfuls of diamonds,

cockatrice
	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
	just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
	to wither.
	
	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
	sicken and die.

	Curses are longstanding ill-wishings which, in Fantasyland,

	[...]
	4.  Curses on Rings and Swords.  You have problems.  Rings
	have to be returned whence they came, preferably at over a
	thousand degrees Fahrenheit, and the Curse means you won't
	want to do this.  Swords usually resist all attempts to
	raise their Curses.  Your best source is to hide the Sword

	A pack of snow-white, red-eared spectral hounds which

cyclops
	The one-eyed giants, the cyclops, were the forgers of Zeus's 
	thunderbolts. Zeus killed Apollo's son Asclepius (Aesculapius)
	with one such thunderbolt in retribution for Asclepius giving
	mortals the skills to evade death, thus upsetting the natural
	order of the world. Apollo responded by slaying the cyclops.

	And after he had milked his cattle swiftly,
	he again took hold of two of my men
	and had them as his supper.
	Then I went, with a tub of red wine,
	to stand before the Cyclops, saying:
	"A drop of wine after all this human meat,
	so you can taste the delicious wine
	that is stored in our ship, Cyclops."
	He took the tub and emptied it.
	He appreciated the priceless wine that much
	that he promptly asked me for a second tub.
	"Give it", he said, "and give me your name as well".
			...
	Thrice I filled the tub,
	and after the wine had clouded his mind,
	I said to him, in a tone as sweet as honey:
	"You have asked my name, Cyclops?  Well,
	my name is very well known.  I'll give it to you,
	if you give me the gift you promised me as a guest.
	My name is Nobody.  All call me thus:
	my father and my mother and my friends."
	Ruthlessly he answered to this:
	"Nobody, I will eat you last of all;
	your host of friends will completely precede you.
	That will be my present to you, my friend."
	And after these words he fell down backwards,
	restrained by the all-restrainer Hupnos.

Daruth Xaxox
	Past the edge of reality is a relic from the Material Plane: a 
	stone keep securely lashed to the trunk of a dessicated tree a 
	mile in diameter. This was an outpost of mages too intent on 
	discovering forbidden knowledge to fear for their own sanity. 
	Nor do they fear insanity now, for rational thought has departed
	those who still live. Amid the wreckage of a laboratory, 
	barracks, kitchen, small library, and specimen cells, some 
	powerful spellcasters and their servants yet wander. Daruth 
	Winterwood, an ancient elven mage, led the expedition, but 
	now his brain is full of spiders. Literally.
	
	Still, he seeks to return Xaxox to the Material Plane in one 
	piece. Every now and then he coaxes open a small portal, allowing
	the essence of the Far Realm to seep onto some random plane, 
	troubling the dreams of those who reside there. Should Daruth 
	ever attract assistance from those on the far side of his 
	portals, or manage to transfer Xaxox on his own, a permanent 
	portal between the Far Realm and the Material Plane could open. 
	Anticipation of the tidal wave of insanity that would follow is 
	the delight that continues to inspire Daruth's mania.

	some bones, and a pile of dust. 
	When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the
	lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to
	even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body
	at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done
	centuries ago.

	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the

	brought death and disaster.

	Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can

	mortal may meet his gaze and live to tell of it.
	
	The demon towers over you, his body at once sinuous like
	that of a snake and powerful like that of a great ape. Two
	baleful baboon heads leer from atop his lumbering shoulders,
	attached to which are two long, bifurcated tentacles. His

	iron, fire or any other means, unless it is placed in the hot blood
	of a goat; with sharp pieces of diamond other stones are engraved and
	polished. It is no greater than a small nut. There are six kinds,
	however Adamant attracts metal; it expels venom; it produces amber
	(and is efficacious against empty fears and for those resisting spells).
	It is found in India, in Greece and in Cyprus, where magicians make use
	of it. It gives you courage; it averts apparitions; it removes anger and
	quarrels; it heals the mad; it defends you from your enemies. It should be

dilithium*
	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary 
	"minerals" of Star Trek is dilithium. ... Because of this
	mineral's central role in the storyline, a whole mythology
	surrounds it. It is, however, a naturally occurring substance
	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort. That said, the real mineral that 
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate. 
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general 
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a 
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the 
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27. A 
	mineral with this composition could theoretically exist, although
	it is doubtful that it would possess the more fantastic properties
	ascribed to dilithium.

	Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. He took me to 
	his cabin and he told me his secret. 'I am not the Dread Pirate 
	Roberts' he said. 'My name is Ryan; I inherited the ship from 
	the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit 
	it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread 
	Pirate Roberts either. His name was Cummerbund. The real 
	Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in 
	Patagonia.'

dream quasielemental
	The region of dreams is near to the elemental planes
	in many respects, being the weakest and most impermanent
	of the shapings of the possible into the actual.
	
	The emanations of dream, then, are not true elementals,
	but are similar to them in some respects.  Dream 
	quasielementals are also able to take the forms of a
	wide variety of creatures, though they never hold the
	same from long.
drider
	A droven punishment form uniting the upper body of a drow 
	with the lower body of a giant spider. This form is 
	typically inflicted on drow matrons who fail a test set 
	out by Lolth, or who scheme and plot against others 
	without benifit to themselves, or who value material 
	things above all else. Driders are cast out of droven 
	society, driven deep into the underdark tunnels, far from 
	the cities of the drow. As with all punishment forms, 
	conversion into a drider also renders the victim sterile. 
	Driders, then, have been given the _form_ of the deity 
	Lolth, but have been deprived of the _essence_ of what it 
	means to be drow.
drow*
	Myths exist for a purpose - To explain the unexplainable.
	Because man fears the unknown.
	
	Murdering our kin. Our children.
	Butchering our towns.
	Devouring our flesh.
	Enslaving our people.
	Whispering of incest.
	Desecrating our lands.
	These mythical black demons with red eyes, embodying all
	the sins of men.
	
	But what if those demons truly exist?
				What are they, who are they?
		Do they dream?
				 Do they hate and love?
			Do they have their own demons that represent
			everything they despise and fear?
	[ Drowtales, by Kern, Kite, and Bandit, Drowtales.com ]
	
	Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil 
	subterranean offshoot of the elvish species.
	
	White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost 
	any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and 
	thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often 
	a vivid red.

*drum*
	Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and
	some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of
	the wild, weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle,
	but Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, is, doubtless, the only human
	being who ever joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel
	of the Dum-Dum.

dunce*
	A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's cap,
	or dunce's hat, is a tall conical hat. In popular culture, it
	is typically made of paper and often marked with a D, and given
	to schoolchildren to wear as punishment for being stupid or
	lazy. While this is now a rare practice, it is frequently depicted
	in popular culture such as children's cartoons.

~dwarf ??m*
dwarf*
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

earendil
elwing
	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and
	Men became estranged, as he most wished, those of the Elven-race
	that lived still in Middle-earth waned and faded, and Men usurped
	the sunlight.  Then the Quendi wandered in the lonely places of the
	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the
	offspring of elf and mortal, Earendil, and Elwing, and Elrond
	their child.

edderkop
	Ettercaps resemble hunched, grey-purplish humanoid aberrations with 
	distended white underbellies, spider-like faces (fangs and eyes and 
	such), and two sharp, black chitinous claws instead of hands and 
	feet. They are not particularly intelligent. Ettercaps possess the 
	capability to shoot sticky webs and have an affinity for monstrous 
	spiders, which they keep as pets and guards. They are cowardly and 
	vicious, and prefer to set traps to ensnare their enemies.

	The edderkops found in the Dungeons of Doom are dark brown or black
	in color, and are known to be shadowsmiths of fearsome power. The
	shadow-forged blades and bolts of the edderkops pass through armor
	without resistance, and have claimed the lives of many an adventurer.
eel
giant eel
	The behaviour of eels in fresh water extends the air of
	mystery surrounding them.  They move freely into muddy, silty
	bottoms of lakes, lying buried in the daylight hours in summer.
	[...]  Eels are voracious carnivores, feeding mainly at
	night and consuming a wide variety of fishes and invertebrate
	creatures.  Contrary to earlier thinking, eels seek living
	rather than dead creatures and are not habitual eaters of

effigy
	An effigy is a representation of a specific person in the form of
	sculpture or some other three-dimensional medium. The use of the

	arbitrary way: recumbent effigies on tombs are so called, but
	standing statues of individuals, or busts, are usually not.

	This effigy is magical, and its self-immolation will cleanse

		[ The Enormous Egg, by Oliver Butterworth ]
eladrin
	The eladrins are the native race of Arborea, just as the
	devils are associated with the Nine Hells and the demons with
	the Abyss. They're wild and free beings who exult in their own
	existence and live a life of song and celebration. The eladrins
	aid all people of good hearts against the forces of evil, but
	seek to do so with individual acts of kindness or heroism.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
noviere*
water dolphin*
	The seas and islands of Ossa, the second layer of Arborea, are
	the home of the noviere eladrins. Like the bralani, the novieres
	are a people who celebrate the beauty of the lands and emerald
	waters around them. They're the most straightforward and
	approachable of the eladrins. The shieres are blocks of ice to
	the typical cutter traveling in Arborea, the bralani are fickle
	and flighty, and trying to talk seriously to a coure can drive a
	sod barmy  but the novieres're willing to take a basher at his
	word and deal with him the way he deals with them.

	The novieres appear to be aquatic elves or nixies. Their skins
	are greenish, blue, or golden in hue, and their hair ranges from
	deep blue-green to pale blond. They're equally at home in the
	water or on land. The novieres're somewhat more human in
	appearance than a full-blooded aquatic elf; they're stockier,
	and have no prominent gills or webbing in their fingers. Their
	eyes mirror the color of the seas around them. In addition to
	their demihuman form, novieres can take on the shape of golden
	dolphins made entirely of shimmering water.

	Novieres prefer to remain in the seas of Ossa, but sometimes
	journey to other planes or prime-material worlds to visit with
	ocean nymphs or merfolk. They love exploring a new coastline or
	listening to the sound of the surf on a strange shore. Of all
	eladrins, the novieres are most likely to be interested in trade
	or material things; they're fascinated by gemstones and jewelry.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
bralani*
singing sand*
	The snowy, sandy wastes of Pelion are home to the bralani 
	eladrins. They're the wildest and most feral of their kind,
	existing from heartbeat to heartbeat in a glorious, never-ending
	passion. No eladrin can match the fury of an angry bralani, or
	the keening depths of her grief or sorrow, or the blissful
	heights of her joy. Bralani are tied to the plains of Pelion,
	but may occasionally be found dancing in the desert winds or
	arctic wastes of other realms, exulting in their freedom and
	the beauty of the open land.

	Bralani in their demihuman form resemble short, stocky elves,
	broad in the shoulders but graceful nonetheless. Their hair is
	usually a bright silvery-white, and their eyes are an
	everchanging rainbow of hues that flicker and shift with the
	vagaries of the bralani's mood. Bralani can also take the shape
	of a whirlwind of dust, sand, or snow, racing across their
	beloved plains like living zephyrs.

	Bralani are the most distant and fey of the eladrins, dangerous
	to approach and fickle in temperament. Strangers might be 
	greeted with wild celebration or attacked in a towering rage.
	Although the bralani's purpose seems to be to dance and race
	about in the wastes, they'll drop their endless dance in a
	moment if they come across evil in their domain. A few rare and
	unusual bralani sojourning in other worlds ally themselves with
	the local forces of good, siding with a tribe of noble desert
	savages or aiding a group of northern herdsmen.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
firre*
dancing flame*
	It shouldn't be any surprise that there are eladrins who devote
	themselves to art, music, and magic. The firres (pronounced
	feers) are creatures who live for beauty; their lives are
	consumed by a fiery passion for art of any kind, and they
	strive to make their own existence a living image of wonder
	and delight.

	The firre eladrins live as wandering minstrels and bards in
	Arborea, attending the courts of more powerful eladrins or
	tarrying to entertain a circle of coures in a forgotten dell.
	Their pursuit of beauty leads them to any place where art,
	skill, or grace is held in high esteem. A body could run
	across a firre traveling the Outlands or visiting the palaces
	of neutral-aligned powers just as easily as he'd find one in
	Arborea. Firres have a deep love and appreciation of mortal
	art, and often embark on lengthy sojourns on the Prime
	Material Plane to seek out works of excellence.

	In their demihuman, firre eladrins resemble stocky elves with
	brilliant red hair and fiery red eyes. At first glance, a
	firre might be taken for a half-elf, but her eyes give her
	away; they have no iris or pupil, and glow brightly with the
	firre's inner flame. Firres can also transform themselves
	into man-size pillars or balls of fire.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
shiere*
ball of light
	The warriors of Arborea are the shieres, graceful eladrin 
	knights who fight with skill, strength, and honor. They're
	the defenders of the eladrin courts, a shining host that
	seeks out evil intruders and ensures that no darkness will
	trouble the Queen of Stars or her people. By night the
	shieres gather together in bright companies to ride the
	wilds of Olympus and drive away any who would do the folk
	of Arborea harm.

	The shieres appear to be exceptionally tall high elves of
	some kind. They're long-limbed and slender, with lanky
	frames and long, narrow faces and hands. A shiere's as
	strong as the mightiest mortal warrior despite his slender
	build. All shieres are very fair-skinned, with pale golden
	or silver hair and piercing eyes of blue, green, or violet.

	Unlike the other eladrins, shieres're bound more permanently
	into their demihuman form and can change shape only into a
	harmless ball of faerie-light, similar to that of a coure
	eladrin.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
ghaele*
luminous cloud*
	The ghaeles are the knights errant of the eladrins. Wherever
	evil and tyranny raise their ugly heads, the ghaeles respond.
	Working behind the scenes, they quietly muster resistance and
	offer guidance to any creatures of good heart with the courage
	to stand against their oppressors. More than any other
	eladrins, the ghaeles are accustomed to working from behind
	the veil.

	Ghaeles resemble tall, athletic high elves. They might easily
	be taken noble elves if not for their pearly, opalescent eyes
	and radiant aura. Of course, a ghaele may be wearing any
	manner of mortal guise when encountered away from Arborea.
	Ghaele eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal cloud
	of luminous energy.
		[ Monstrous Manual, Planescape Appendix 2 ]
tulani*
ball of radiance
	The greatest of the eladrins are the tulani, or faerie lords.
	Their courts are scattered throughout Olympus, never staying
	in the same place more than one night. The tulani are
	peaceful in nature and take up arms only when Arborea itself
	is threatened or the direst of emergencies requires their
	attention.

	Tulani're creatures of unearthly beauty and grace; their
	voices are living music, and their faces shine so brightly
	that mortals find it difficult to look at them. In form
	they're tall, stately elven lords dressed in shimmering
	robes of shifting color. A tulani is surrounded by a magical
	aura that evil creatures cannot bear to be near. Tulani
	eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal globe of
	eldritch colors, 5' in diameter.

	Visitors to Arborea who seek out the tulani courts soon find
	out that the eladrins aren't easy to find when they want to
	avoid someone. When a cutter finally gets to meet with a
	tulani, he's wise to keep his bone-box shut and mind his
	manners. The tulani don't tolerate insolence or disrespect
	from mortals, but are gracious hosts when their guests
	behave themselves.

elder brain
	The elder brain is a huge, fibrous mass of cognizant brain 
	tissue covered with writhing feelers. A single elder brain 
	floats within the depths of a briny pool found at the center 
	of its illithid community.
	
	The elder brain is the center of its illithid community, 
	serving as an advisor and, most importantly, the living 
	repository of the community's technology, history, and psionic 
	expertise. It is the right and obligation of every illithid to 
	merge with the elder brain after death  living in exalted 
	mentality while guiding and shepherding its erstwhile 
	community. While most illithids believe that their personality 
	will survive the transition, individual egos are suborned to 
	the gestalt consciousness suffusing the tissue mass.

	An strange symbol that has come down to the younger races out

	The sign is effective alone, or in groups of up to six; five 
	forming a star around the first: three above and two below.
	
	A simple elder sign is composed of six strokes; however, due
	to the more complex star shape of the reinforced ward, 
	expanding the sign requires ten strokes for the first arm,
	and eight thereafter.

	2) He was never exhibited in public houses to the curious; only

		the scientific and literary community.

	4) He did indeed have what most people would commonly understand 
		as "eyes."
	
	5) He was not actually the pilot of the Zeppelin, although he did 
		disappear for good following the explosion.

	6) There is obviously no "underground kingdom beneath London, 
		inhabited by huge, intelligent rodents." And even if there were,
		and suggestion of Neil's involvement in the mazy territorial

	There was no light source for the sword to be reflecting

	The eye!  The terrible eye!  Its gaze will doom us all!
eye of the aethiopica
	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries
	it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces
	any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and
	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the
	dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between
	areas.
eyes of the overworld
	... and finally there is "the Eyes of the Overworld".  This
	obscure artifact pushes the wearer's view sense into the
	"overworld" -- another name for a segment of the Astral Plane.
	Usually, there is nothing to be seen.  However, the wearer
	is also able to look back and see the area around herself,
	much like looking on a map.  Why anyone would want to ...

fauchard
	This weapon is a development of the scythe or sickle. Set 
	upon a long pole, the curving blade of a fauchard can be 
	used for both cutting and thrusting. The weapon offers little 
	in the way of parrying or catching/holding and has no provision 
	for dismounting opponents, though it is quite useful for crippling 
	their mounts.

fallen angel
	Lucifer rebelled.
	
	The angels fell.
	
	We have only the tales of mortals to guide us on this. We,
	the heirs of angels, must piece together our heritage from
	the scraps of myth. We can surmise that some divine force
	exiled Lucifer and his followers. We use their word, God,
	because it is a convenient shorthand for our unknown
	enemy. The demon race was bred to overthrow this enemy and
	take its throne and whatever else we forget, we should
	never forget that destiny. A full third of the Host fell,
	according to some accounts. For their sins  for pride,
	for rebellion, for desiring to be like God, for unknowable
	and ineffable reasons  they were banished and they fell.

	Some hats can only be worn if you're willing to be jaunty, to set

*fern*
	These dreadful weeds have been driven to extinction on the
	surface, yet deep within the dark and damp of the dungeon
	they still flourish. When it detects the motion of nearby
	creatures, the dungeon fern releases a deadly, poisonous
	spore, which quickly detonates to propagate the species.

	Residents of the dungeon have learned how not to disturb
	the dungeon fern, and will attack its spores on sight to
	keep them from overtaking their home.

	More than one variety of this plant is known to exist.

	Then it appeared in Paris at just about the time that Paris
	was full of Carlists who had to get out of Spain.  One of
	them must have brought it with him, but, whoever he was, it's
	likely he knew nothing about its real value.  It had been --
	no doubt as a precaution during the Carlist trouble in Spain
	-- painted or enameled over to look like nothing more than a
	fairly interesting black statuette.  And in that disguise,
	sir, it was, you might say, kicked around Paris for seventy
	years by private owners and dealers too stupid to see what
	it was under the skin.

wand of death
	"Your sad excuse for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you
	expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in place. This, my
	young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge you will never find in my
	lessons. You do not encounter mountain trolls in open daylight! The idea that
	you should use sunlight to stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors
	trying to show off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality.
	Just because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with mountain
	trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it! The Killing Curse is
	unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain."

flail
nunchaku
	The flail the weapon is derived from the flail the agricultural
	tool. The original is made by connecting a wooden handle to a 
	wooden club with a rope, and is used for thrashing grain. The
	weapon is made by connecting a handle to a club, metal bar, 
	spiked ball, or whatever will hurt the most. It is used for 
	thrashing advesaries.
	The nunchaku is a Japanese variaty of flail on which the
	business end and handle are identical. This allows for a fast-
	paced eastern style of thrashing advesaries.
floating eye
	Floating eyes, not surprisingly, are large, floating eyeballs
	which drift about the dungeon.  Though not dangerous in and
	of themselves, their power to paralyse those who gaze at
	their large eye in combat is widely feared.  Many are the
	tales of those who struck a floating eye, were paralysed by
	its mystic powers, and then nibbled to death by some other
	creature that lurked around nearby.
flesh golem
	With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark
	of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow
	eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
	motion agitated its limbs.
	
	How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how
	delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I
	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God!
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
	only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
	seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in
	which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight
	black lips.

	The little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest

	a slice of new cheese and an apple.  Each thing had a separate
	stem, and so had to be picked off the side of the box; but

	took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning
	round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with

~violet fungus
*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

	I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew;
	Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.
	Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,
	and by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.
	Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,
	in Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.
	There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,
	while here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.
	O Lorien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;
	The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.
	O Lorien! Too long have I dwelt upon this Hither Shore

	white face, red wings, and an eagle's beak and with a crown
	on his head. This ancient deity was said to be massive,

	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.
	
	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good
	speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly

	speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same
	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the

	Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are

	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely

	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild

githyanki*
	Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell 
	upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war 
	on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the 
	githzerai.

	Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are 
	approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and 
	long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black 
	eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman 
	races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. 
	Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their 
	baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, 
	beads, and precious metals and gems.

	History provides some information on the githyanki  their race 
	is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were 
	humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and 
	cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and 
	the people harbored a deep resentment toward the illithids. For 
	centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not 
	summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for 
	many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an 
	opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman 
	of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. 
	She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. 
	The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people 
	freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the 
	githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).

	oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under which he carried his
	sword of sharpness.  

	When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but
	could not reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places;
	and at length, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all
	his might, he cut off both his legs. Then Jack, setting his foot
	upon his neck, plunged his sword into the giant's body, when the
	monster gave a groan and expired.

gnomish wizard
	...  And then a gnome came by, carrying a bundle, an old
	fellow three times as large as an imp and wearing clothes of
	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.
	'White magic.  Run!'  said the gnome ..

	"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Harry told Ron as
	they crossed the lawn.
	"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron,
	bent double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little
	Santa Clauses with fishing rods..."
	There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered,
	and Ron straightened up.  "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
	"Geroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
	It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus.  It was small and
	leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like
	a potato.  Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him
	with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles
	and turned it upside down.

	Goddesses and Gods operate in ones, threesomes, or whole

	to have made the world, and this is indeed a likely claim in
	the case of threesomes or pantheons:  Fantasyland does have
	the air of having been made by a committee.  But all Goddesses
	and Gods, whether they say they made the world or not, have
	very detailed short-term plans for it which they are determined
	to carry out.  Consequently they tend to push people into the
	required actions by the use of coincidence or Prophecy, or just
	by narrowing down your available choices of what to do next:
	if a deity is pushing you, things will go miserably badly until
	there is only one choice left to you.

*golem
	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
	destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
	left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in
	the Old Synagogue." ...

gorgoneion
	Among the Ancient Greeks the most widely-used image intended to

	Its strings break only in very rare instances, usually
	because the Harper is sulking or crossed in love.  This is
	just as well as no one seems to make or sell spare strings.

	ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
	Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down
	like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the
	table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and
	dashed with it towards the door.  But the harp called out

halberd
	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe 
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle, 
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact 
	upon an enemy. This alone makes it quite distinct from an 
	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length, 
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by 
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward. 
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay 
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when 
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was 
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a 
	hook for dismounting opponents.

	that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a

	outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
	within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
	occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
	brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.

hell hound*
	Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of

	hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red-brown fur,
	and red, glowing eyes.  The markings, teeth, and tongue are
	soot black.  It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder
	and has a distinct odour of smoke and sulphur.  The baying
	sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that sends a shiver
	through any who hear them.
	
	But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his
	lips parted in amazement.  At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell
	of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I sprang
	to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by
	the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of
	the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not
	such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its
	open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle
	and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame. Never
	in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more
	savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that dark
	form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.

*heptagram
	The heptagram, a sevenpointed star, is an obvious development 
	of the pentagram, once it was discovered. The number seven is
	well known in symbolism. The traditional seven planets (the 
	wandering celestial bodies as opposed to the fixed stars) were
	associated with seven celestial spheres, thus the old 
	expression "to be in seventh heaven". The names of the seven
	days of the week may have been derived from the ordering of 
	planets based on orbital period according to the paths of the
	heptagram.
		[ Adapted from symbols.com, the online encyclopedia of

	The heptagram ward requires 21 strokes to draw, and is one of
	the most broadly effective wards. It may be reinforced up to
	seven times.
*hexagram
	The hexagram is based on the triangle gestalt. The earliest
	examples found are dated back to around 800-600 B.C. 
	If the structure had been designed by a process of random 
	experimentation with the basic gestalt, the hexagram as 
	graphically simpler than the pentagram would have been 
	created long before it. Present archeological and historical
	facts, however, indicate that it first appeared at least
	3,000 years later than the pentgram. It is sometimes reffered 
	to as Solomon's seal, though the sign on Solomon's seal is 
	believed to have been a pentagram, and it is frequently used 
	in the magic formulas in the old book of witchcraft, 
	The Key of Solomon.
	
    The alchemists of the Middle Ages used the hexagram first and 
	foremost as a general symbol representing the art of alchemy 
	and secondly as a sign for combinations of water and fire. 
	Combined these two triangles formed the symbol for fire water, 
	the essence or spiritus of wine: alcohol. It was also used as
	a sign for quintessence, the fifth element.

	Composed of just twelve strokes, the hexagram can be drawn 
	fairly quickly. It may be reinforced up to seven times.
hermes
	Messenger and herald of the Olympians.  Being required to do
	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said

	returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The
	Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of

	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
	numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
	and quiet and good tilled earth:  a well-ordered and well-
	farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they

hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul

	of the brownie type.  In "A midsummer night's dream" a
	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be

imp or minor demon
	 ... imps ... little creatures of two feet high that could

		[ The Charwoman's Shadow, by Lord Dunsany ]
	
	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from

incantifier
	Several centuries ago, there existed a faction, now almost 
	entirely extinct, called nowadays 'The Incantifers', then 
	simply as The Magicians or The Wanters. They believed that 
	magic, specifically arcane magic, was the key to power, 
	indeed the only power that mattered in the multiverse. Gain 
	enough knowledge of magic and skill in it and you could do 
	anything. Even challenge The Lady....
	
	According to legend, at least two members of the Wanters 
	tried just that. They died, horribly and spectacularly. 
	Legend also says that one of them almost succeeded.
	
	Then one day, they vanished. Cutters looked up one 
	morning and the Tower Sorcerous, the faction headquarters 
	of the Wanters was simply gone. Nearly all of their 
	members vanished with it, though a scant few remain to 
	wander the planes.

	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly

	metal and stone, surmounts a whirling orrery of rings
	of pure metals and carved stone.  In the gaps between
	segments of its admixed skin can be seen interlocking
	gears of like composition to the rings of its orrery.

kiku*ichi*
	The thirteen swordsmiths of the Fukuoka School traditionally
	inscribed only the character "Ichi" (one) on the tang of 
	their swords as their signature. They further received 
	permission to append the Imperial chrysanthemum crest (kiku) 
	on the tang, thus their swords are known collectively as 
	"Kiku-ichimonji" (Chrysanthemum and Ichi character).
ki-rin
	The ki-rin is a strange-looking flying creature.  It has
	scales, a mane like a lion, a tail, hooves, and a horn.  It

*arthur
	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the
	anvil had been placed.  There, standing before the anvil, he
	commanded Kay:  "Put the sword back into the steel if you
	really think the throne is yours!"  But the sword glanced
	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only
	by birth but also by law", Ector said.  "You are no son of
	mine nor are you Kay's brother.  Immediately after your birth,
	Merlin the Wise brought you to me to be raised safely.  And
	though it was me that named you Arthur when you were baptized,
	you are really the son of brave king Uther Pendragon and queen
	Igraine..."
	And after these words, the lord rose and went to see the arch-
	bishop to impart to him what had passed.

	When Death at last had struck him down,

~winged kobold
*kobold*
	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
*kop*
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.
	
	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both
	poetry and philosophy in this fact, but most of all, there is
	humor.  Sennett got the humor.)

	"Below the thunders of the upper deep; 
	Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea, 
	His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep 
	The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee 
	About his shadowy sides: above him swell

	And far away into the sickly light, 
	From many a wondrous grot and secret cell 
	Unnumber'd and enormous polypi 
	Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green. 
	There hath he lain for ages and will lie 
	Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,

	Then once by man and angels to be seen, 
	In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die."

*lady
	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various
	orifices had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of
	his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives.  She smiled.  This
	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.
	
	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.
	
	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,
	weally!"  With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens
	into the centre of the table.
	
	The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held
	it as steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three
	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.
	
	A six.  A three.  A five.
	
	Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the
	chance collision of several billion molecules, the die flipped
	onto a point, spun gently and came down a seven.  Blind Io
	picked up the cube and counted the sides.
	
	"Come _on_," he said wearily, "Play fair."

*lamp
	When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed,
	and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the
	garden, which were in reality precious stones.  He then asked
	for some food.
	
	"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I
	have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it."
	
	Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
	instead.  As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it
	might fetch a higher price.  Instantly a hideous genie
	appeared, and asked what she would have.  She fainted away,
	but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:
	"Fetch me something to eat!"

	With this the wind increased, and the mill sails began to turn

	And, after saying this, and commending himself most devoutly
	to his Lady Dulcinea, desiring her to succor him in that trance,
	covering himself well with his buckler, and setting his lance
	on his rest, he spurred on Rozinante, and encountered with the
	first mill that was before him, and, striking his lance into
	the sail, the wind swung it about with such fury, that it broke
	his lance into shivers, carrying him and his horse after it,
	and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in 
	evil plight.

lava
* lava
	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
	out, cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the
	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving
	everything an eerie, macabre appearance. The air is filled with
	flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. The walls 
	are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out 
	all other sounds. Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are 
	myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which 
	scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls. To 
	one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured 
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself. An 
	immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, 
	burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit 
	far off to your left. To the right, an immense geyser of blistering 
	steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a
	sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. The far right wall is aflame
	with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal
	splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark, forboding passage 
	exits to the south.

lembas*
	In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender
	goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and
	brought them many gifts of food and clothing for their
	journey.  The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes,
	made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
	and inside was the colour of cream.  Gimli took up one of the
	cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.
	'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp
	corner and nibbled at it.  His expression quickly changed,
	and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
	'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing.  'You have
	eaten enough already for a long day's march.'
	'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen
	make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.
	'So it is,' they answered.  'But we call it lembas or
	waybread, and it is more strengthening than any foods made by
	Men, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts.'

lemure
larvae
	The Larvae (Lemures) are Roman spirits of deceased family members.
	These malignant spirits dwell throughout the house and frighten the
	inhabitants. People tried to reconcile or avert the Larvae with
	strange ceremonies which took place on May 9, 11, and 13; this
	was called the "Feast of the Lemures". The master of the house
	usually performed these ceremonies, either by offering black beans
	to the spirits or chasing them away by making a lot of noise. Their
	counterparts are the Lares, friendly and beneficent house spirits.
		[ Encyclopedia Mythica, ed. M.F. Lindemans ]
	
	The lowliest of the inhabitants of hell.
	
	The lemures fester at the very bottom of the scale of
	baatezu politics.  Again, many scholars seem reluctant
	to classify them as true baatezu, leaving them officially
	unranked and definitely unamed.  The lemures are the 
	mindless armies of the Blood War, the rank-and-file, 
	incapable of making decisions on their own.  They're
	driven into battle by threats of pain and destruction.
	However, as pathetic as they are, lemures are also the
	steppingstone to greater things.

	frame to serve as a shield against the cut and thrust of the

	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

	Phaeton felt a rushing then, as if he were being pulled

	here was absolute, and the pressure on him immense.
	Something swam by him, and the elf recognized
	the creature again, grown somehow into immensity, and
	glowing eerily. It peered at him and spoke in his mind;
	the foundations of his sanity trembled. Somehow Phaeton
	could perceive that this was just an image, a shadow
	of something far greater; he saw in his mind's eye a
	creature encased in ice, frozen and unable to touch the
	world.
	
	Here you will forget. The creature seemed to swim
	lazily about him. But there is something you must yet do.
	
	What? Phaeton thought back.
	
	Don't you remember?
	
	A strange sensation burned in the elf's lungs, and
	recognition dawned.
	Oh, yes, he thought. I must breathe.

*lich
death knight
	Once in a great while, an evil master wizard or priest will
	manage through use of great magics to extend his or her life
	far beyond the normal span of a human. The usual effect of
	this is to transform the human, over time, into an undead of
	great magical power. A Lich hates life in any form; even a
	touch from one of these creatures will cause a numbing cold
	in the victim. They all possess the capability to use magic.
	
	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

lillend
	A lillend has the torso, arms, and head of a comely man or woman, 
	but also has broad, powerful, feathered wings and a stout 
	serpentine body from the waist downwards. Though the humanlike 
	portions of a lillend are of unremarkable hue, the feathered and 
	scaled parts of its anatomy are brightly colored and strikingly 
	patterned. Each individual has its own unique color combination 
	and is quite proud of it. A lillend wears no clothing but 
	sometimes wears jewelry. It always carries weapons and musical 
	instruments.
	
	Lillendi social status depends on a simple system of initiations 
	into mysteries and the ownership of certain totem masks. The 
	mysteries are akin to secret societies, and each mystery is a 
	specific kernel of wisdom passed on from one generation to the 
	next. The more societies a lillend is a member of, the greater 
	her status. Each society is devoted to particular musical forms, 
	songs, instruments, and weapons, so a group of lillendi usually 
	uses the same instruments, weaponry, and spells.

	The masks are tangentially related to the societies, since each 
	mask design belongs to a specific family, and long ago each 
	family lived in a single lodge and wore a single type of mask. 
	Things have gotten a little more complicated since then, but the 
	masks still roughly indicate status and family affiliations.

crone lilith
	It seems as if Euryale has always dwelt in the Hells. 
	Beelzebub named his present city (Malegard) after her in 
	ancient times, when she was the mistress of discipline there.
	She customarily takes the form of an old arthritic-looking 
	hag with the strength of a titan and serpentine hair. In 
	various forms she visits the copper citidels of her plane; 
	if the inhabitants do not respond appropriately the burg is 
	destroyed in a vast inferno and servants are dispatched to 
	build another. 
	Euryale is the third ruler of Malebolge. Euryale replaced 
	Moloch, who in turn replaced Count Beherit, who was 
	destroyed by the Dark Lord for disobeying restrictions on 
	the elevation of devils. Lilith and Tartach convinced her 
	to stage a coup during the mad cycles of the last Reckoning, 
	and as a result she is no longer considered a subordinate

mother lilith
	Lilith was crafted by the Lords of Baator to haunt Prime 
	Material deserts, stealing children, corrupting men, and 
	recruiting witches to their cause. Thought to be older 
	than humanity, Lilith fulfilled her role across the 
	ages until it was feared she might become a goddess. 
	To prevent this from happening, she was bound to Count 
	Moloch, who became the Horned King to her Great Goddess.
	She viewed him with hatred, and thought fondly of the 
	kiss of the desert wind and her throngs of adoring 
	consorts and covens. 
	
	During the last Great Upheaval, while Beelzebub and his
	camp were busy with the war, she made her move. She 
	whispered to her lover that his greatest opportunities
	lay with supporting the Lord of the Flies. Asmodeus cast 
	him down, and made his consort ruler in his place.
	
	Moloch was sent away in disgrace, but Lilith was still 
	unsatisfied. She knew Asmodeus was watching her progress
	and feared that he had allowed her to retain the sixth 
	layer of Baator only because she was being groomed to be
	his bride. Knowing well what had happened to Bensozia, 
	Asmodeus' previous choice, she maneuvered to prevent this
	from happening.
	
	Secretly, she corrupted certain officials in Malsheem and
	managed to smuggle out a small quantity of the essence of
	Asmodeus and Benzozia to the yugoloths, with Glasya the 
	result. She hoped that a daughter would satisfy whatever

	Loki, or Lopt, is described in Snorri's _Edda_ as being
	"pleasing and handsome in appearance, evil in character, and
	very capricious in behaviour".  He is the son of the giant
	Farbauti and of Laufey.
	Loki is the Norse god of cunning, evil, thieves, and fire.
	He hated the other gods and wanted to ruin them and overthrow
	the universe.  He committed many murders.  As a thief, he
	stole Freyja's necklace, Thor's belt and gauntlets of power,
	and the apples of youth.  Able to shapechange at will, he is
	said to have impersonated at various times a mare, flea, fly,
	falcon, seal, and an old crone.  As a mare he gave birth to
	Odin's horse Sleipnir.  He also allegedly sired the serpent
	Midgard, the mistress of the netherworld, Hel, and the wolf
	Fenrir, who will devour the sun at Ragnarok.

lug
lugh
	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.

	The lurker is a carnivorous scavenger found only in subterranean

	unless actually prodded. ... Lurkers are opportunistic feeders
	that make do with whatever wanders by. The lurker flies by means

	In 1573, the Parliament of Dole published a decree, permitting
	the inhabitants of the Franche-Comte to pursue and kill a
	were-wolf or loup-garou, which infested that province,
	"notwithstanding the existing laws concerning the chase."
	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little
	children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears,

	To dream of seeing a lynx, enemies are undermining your

	I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to 
	come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless 
	to act, my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, 
	so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I 
	slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me 
	that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the 
	clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was 
	dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, 
	but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through 
	the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into 
	the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window 
	before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain 
	on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs 
	and even my will. I lay still and endured, that was all. I 
	closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It 
	is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how 
	conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker 
	and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like 
	smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, 
	not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. 
	It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became 
	concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, 
	through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining 
	like a red eye.

	the pains and joys, the jealousies and doubts, all of these 
	served as a guiding stone to enemies. In becoming flesh, the 
	First People became enslaved to those who *knew* flesh only 
	as tools for their will. *Know* these beasts were the 
	*illithids.*
	
	The *illithids* were a race that had come not to *know* 
	themselves. They had learned how to make other races not 
	*know* themselves.
	
	They were the tentacled ones. They lived in flesh and saw 
	flesh as tools for their will. Their blood was as water 
	and they shaped minds with their thoughts. When the 
	*illithids* came upon the People, the People were a people 
	no more. The People became slaves.

	the mind flayer will slowly drain it of all intelligence,
	eventually killing its victim.

	Mine will be very complex, with many levels of galleries,
	beautifully carved and engineered.  What was being mined here
	is not always evident, but at least some of the time it will
	appear to have been Jewels, since it is customary to find

	What does it mean to fight for the Balance? How is one a part 
	of it, how does it make its way through all things?
	
	Balance is the quest for equilibrium, the movement of all 
	things to the center. If the center cannot hold...that is the
	fear, that the Spire is the foundation that all others 
	foolishly seek to crack and topple in their careless pursuit
	of malice and charity, freedom and constraint.
	
	Yes. But more -- what is the identity of Balance? Its face?
	Who is that face, and what is its identity?
	
	The identity of Balance is its citizens and its guardians. 
	Its citizens are those who are neither too cruel nor too 
	kind. Its guardians however must kill and save innocents, 
	must be selfish and charitable in equal quantities. The face
	of Balance is the rilmani, the guardians. They are forever 
	walking the line, ever seeking to keep themselves in 
	equilibrium. Who they are is this walking, this act of 
	treading upon the thinnest of strands.

mit*ra*
	Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
	was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.

mjollnir
	Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's
	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,
	destruction, and resurrection.

* monk
grand master
master kaen
	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".
	
	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"
	
	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."
	
	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"
	
	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.
	
	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but

	resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the Catholic Mass).
	It was used by both cavalry and infantry; the horseman's weapon
	typically had a shorter haft than the footman's, which might be up
	to six feet long. It came into use in the beginning of the 14th
	century.

	Mortai are a mystery of the Beastlands, enigmatic creatures

	miles from side to side and towering thousands of feet in 
	the air. In fact, a basher who doesn'tknow what he's looking
	for'll walk right under a mortai wihout even realizing that 
	the creature is just drifting along a half mile or so over 
	his head. Most of the time, mortai are happy to remain 
	unnoticed, and can imitate a natural cloud perfectly. But 
	when they want a basher to know they're present, the mortai
	begin to pulsate with a golden glow, crackling with immense
	power like a lightning storm. When a mortai reveals itself
	this way, great faces of wisdom and beauty begin to appear
	on the surface of its clouds.

	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his

nightgaunt
night*gaunt
	Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt 
	his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some
	unseen hand. Then he heard it clatter down over the rocks 
	below. And between him and the Milky Way he thought he saw 
	a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned
	and tailed and bat-winged. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm 
	seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was 
	lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another 
	minute and the stars were gone, and Carter knew that the 
	night-gaunts had got him. 
	
	[They] were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with smooth,
	oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that curved inward 
	toward each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly 
	prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and 
	disquietingly. And worst of all, they never spoke or laughed, 
	and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with, 
	but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be. All 
	they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way 
	of night-gaunts.

nunchaku
	A nunchaku is two sections of wood (or metal in modern
	incarnations) connected by a cord or chain.  There is much
	controversy over its origins; some say it was originally a
	Chinese weapon, others say it evolved from a threshing flail;
	one theory purports that it was developed from a horse's bit.
	Chinese nunchaku tend to be rounded, whereas Japanese are
	octagonal, and they were originally linked by horse hair.
	There are many variations on the nunchaku, ranging from the
	three sectional staff (san-setsu-kon nunchaku), to smaller
	multi-section nunchaku.  The nunchaku was popularized by
	Bruce Lee in a number of films, made in both Hollywood and
	Hong Kong.

~swamp nymph
*nymph
dryad
naiad
oread
	A female creature from Roman and Greek mythology, the nymph
	occupied rivers, forests, ponds, etc.  A nymph's beauty is
	beyond words:  an ever-young woman with sleek figure and
	long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips
	and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her
	long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered
	with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's
	demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.
	
	"Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of
	sleep.	The song was the skeleton of his dream, and the dream
	was full of terror.  Demon girls were after him, and a bull-
	man was goring him.  Everywhere there was blood.  There was
	pain.  There was fear.	But his head was in the nymph's lap
	and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He
	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that
	made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to
	become a hero, suddenly knew then what most heroes learn
	later -- and some too late -- that joy blots suffering and
	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters."
	    [ The Minotaur by Bernard Evslin ]
obsidian*
	A volcanic glass, homogeneous in texture and having a low water
	content, with a vitreous luster and a conchoidal fracture. The
	color is commonly black, but may be some shade of red or brown,
	and cut sections sometimes appear to be green. Like other volcanic
	glasses, obsidian is a lava that has cooled too quickly for the
	contained minerals to crystallize. In chemical composition it is
	rich in silica and similar to granite. It is favored by primitive
	peoples for knives, arrowheads, spearheads, and other weapons
	and tools.
		[ The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition ]
ochre jelly
	This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through darkened
	corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for flesh or
	cellulose to devour. ... Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion
	and trash, this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean
	areas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to
	organize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of
	its danger. 
		[ Monstrous Manual, by TSR inc. ]
odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
offler
	Offler hesitated. He was a very old god, who had arisen from
	steaming swamps in hot, dark lands. He had survived the rise
	and fall of more modern and certainly more beautiful gods by
	developing, for a god, a certain amount of wisdom.
	
	Besides, Nuggan was one of the newer gods, all full of 
	hellfire and self-importance and _ambition_. Offler was not
	bright, but he had some vague inkling that for long-term 
	survival gods needed to offer their worshippers something
	more than a mere lack of thunderbolts. And he felt an 
	ungodlike pang of sympathy for any human whose god banned
	chocolate _and_ garlic.
		[ The Last Hero, by Terry Pratchett ]
	
	'It's _you_, isn't it?' he growled. 'You're Nuggan, aren't 
	you?'
	'You utter, utter...fifteen years! Fifteen damn years before
	I ever tasted garlic! And the priests used to get up early
	in the countryside round us to jump on all the mushrooms!
	And do you know how _much_ a small slab of chocolate cost
	in our town, and what they did to people who were caught with
	one?' The minstrel shouldered the Horde aside and advanced
	on the retreating god, his lyre raised like a club.
	
	'Broccoli,' murmured Offler to Sweevo, God of Cut Timbur,
	'You can't go wrong with broccoli.'
		[ The Last Hero, by Terry Pratchett ]
ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

oilskin cloak
	During our watches below we overhauled our clothes, and made
	and mended everything for bad weather.  Each of us had made
	for himself a suit of oil-cloth or tarpaulin, and these we
	got out, and gave thorough coatings of oil or tar, and hung
	upon the stays to dry.  Our stout boots, too, we covered
	over with a thick mixture of melted grease and tar.  Thus we
	took advantage of the warm sun and fine weather of the
	Pacific to prepare for its other face.

oilskin sack
	Summer passed all too quickly.  On the last day of camp, Mr.
	Brickle called his counselors together and paid them what he

	money he had ever earned.  He had no wallet and no pockets,
	so Mr. Brickle placed the money in a waterproof bag that had
	a drawstring.  He hung this moneybag around Louis' neck,
	along with the trumpet, the slate, the chalk pencil, and the
	lifesaving medal.

olog-hai
	But at the end of the Third Age a troll-race not before seen
	appeared in southern Mirkwood and in the mountain borders of
	Mordor.  Olog-hai they were called in the Black Speech.  That
	Sauron bred them none doubted, though from what stock was not
	known.  Some held that they were not Trolls but giant Orcs;
	but the Olog-hai were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike
	even the largest of Orc-kind, whom they far surpassed in size
	and power.  Trolls they were, but filled with the evil will
	of their master:  a fell race, strong, agile, fierce and
	cunning, but harder than stone.  Unlike the older race of the
	Twilight they could endure the Sun....  They spoke little,
	and the only tongue they knew was the Black Speech of Barad-dur.

oracle
delphi
p*thia
	Delphi under towering Parnassus, where Apollo's oracle was,
	plays an important part in mythology.  Castalia was its
	sacred spring; Cephissus its river.  It was held to be the
	center of the world, so many pilgrims came to it, from
	foreign countries as well as Greece.  No other shrine rivaled
	it.  The answers to the questions asked by the anxious
	seekers for Truth were delivered by a priestess who went into
	a trance before she spoke.
		[ Mythology, by Edith Hamilton ]
orange
pear
	What was the fruit like?  Unfortunately, no one can describe
	a taste.  All I can say is that, compared with those fruits,
	the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and the
	juiciest orange was dry, and the most melting pear was hard
	and woody, and the sweetest wild strawberry was sour.  And
	there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps.  If you had once
	eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would
	taste like medicines after it.  But I can't describe it.  You
	can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that
	country and taste it for yourself.
		[ The Last Battle, by C.S. Lewis ]
phantom fungus
	A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the
	vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in
	search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along
	the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its
	mouth to pinpoint prey.
	
	The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with
	row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks
	more than actual fangs. This "mouth" is not used to feed, however,
	and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than
	a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so
	by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with
	thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to
	siphon away nutrients.
		[ Pathfinder RPG ]
phase spider
	Sometimes confused with neogi or driders and called planar
	spiders on some worlds of the Prime, phase spiders are intelligent
	web-spinners with a raised thorax and a humanlike
	head. What really makes phase spiders stand out is their
	enviable ability to phase back and forth between a plane and
	the plane's Border.
	
	Unknown to most creatures, phase spiders possess
	large web habitats on the Ethereal (both in the Deep and on
	the Border) and only appear on other planes while hunting
	for food. Some phase spiders do live mostly on material
	planes, but these spiders are the exception, not the rule. Like
	many more familiar cultures, Ethereally-based phase spiders
	are not a cohesive race, but instead exist in separate clutches
	(tribes), each of which claims various Prime territories as its
	sole hunting ground. Sometimes disparate phase spider
	clutches cooperate, but sometimes they come into conflict
	over temtorial disputes.

polymorph trap
	One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams,
	he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous 
	verminous bug. He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he 
	lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided 
	up into rigid bow-like sections. From this height the blanket, 
	just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in 
	place. His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the 
	rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

pyrolisk
	At first glance around the corner, I thought it was another 
	cockatrice. I had encountered the wretched creatures two or
	three times since leaving the open area. I quickly ducked my 
	head back and considered what to do next. My heart had begun
	to thump audibly as I patted my pack to make sure I still had 
	the dead lizards at close reach. A check of my attire showed
	no obvious holes or damage. I had to keep moving. One deep
	breath, and a count of three, two, one, and around the corner 
	I bolted. But it was no cockatrice! I felt a sudden intense 
	searing of the skin around my face, and flames began to leap
	from my pack. I tossed it to the ground, and quickly retreated
	back, around that corner, desperately striving to get out of 
	its sight.
*orb of fate
orb of fate
	Some say that Odin himself created this ancient crystal ball,
	although others argue that Loki created it and forged Odin's
	signature on the bottom.  In any case, it is a powerful
	artifact.  Anyone who carries it is granted the gift of
	warning, and damage, both spell and physical, is partially
	absorbed by the orb itself.  When invoked it has the power
	to teleport the invoker between levels.

orcrist
	The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he

	the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did
	battle before their walls.  They had called it Orcrist,
	Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter.
	They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.

	The massive, boated demon stands 15 feet tall, his immense
	frame a hideous combination of muscle and bloated flesh. His

	is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
	a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
	Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
	Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
	needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
	apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
	hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
	ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,
	tools and armours that are used by men.  Since they don't have
	the talent to fashion these themselves, they are constantly
	hunting for them.  There is nothing a horde of orcs cannot

	An ochre jelly resembles a giant amoeba, consisting of a thick, porous, golden 
	sludge. It lurks in dungeons, slowly sludging its way along floors, walls and

	finds them, it extends, latches onto them, and then proceeds to engulf and 
	constrict them. The ochre jelly reproduces asexually, and can sometimes be

orion
sirius
	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a
	mighty hunter. His father gave him the power of wading
	through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
	walking on its surface.
	
	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many
	tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears

orpheus
	Orpheus is a legendary figure, described by most ancient

	Hellenised world as a heroic, civilising benefactor to
	mankind. [...] Pindar calls Orpheus "the father of songs"
	and asserts him as a son of the Thracian king Oeagrus and
	the Muse Calliope.
	[...]
	The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of
	his wife Eurydice (also known as Agriope). [...] Eurydice
	fell into a nest of vipers and she suffered a fatal bite
	on her heel.  Her body was discovered by Orpheus who,
	overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs
	that all the nymphs and gods wept.  On their advice, Orpheus
	traveled to the underworld and by his music softened the
	hearts of Hades and Persephone (he was the only person ever
	to do so), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him
	to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her
	and not look back until they both had reached the upper
	world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his
	anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to
	look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper
	world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.

	stroke.  But the snake was not looking at him.  It was glaring
	over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his

*pentagram
	The pentagram was probably discovered as a result of

	6,000 years ago. Isolated pentagrams have been found on broken 
	fragments of burned clay in Palestine, in layers dating from 
	around 4000 B.C. It was a common sign among the Sumerians around
	2700 B.C. Some of those who have conducted research of symbols
	believe the pentagram was used by the Sumerians as a cosmic 
	symbol representing the four corners of the earth and the vault
	of the heavens. This, however, seems a bit far-fetched. 
	
	After the Sumerian time there is no clear evidence as to what 
	the pentagram might have meant until the sign appears in 
	Pythagorean mysticism, where it represents Hugieia ("health")
	and the five hidden cavities.
	
	The pentagram also symbolizes the five elements, and authority
	over the same. King Solomon was given a ring with a pentagram
	seal that gave him authority over demons and djinn.

pirate brother
	The Brethren or Brethren of the Coast were a loose 
	coalition of pirates and privateers commonly known as 
	buccaneers and active in the seventeenth and eighteenth
	centuries in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and 
	Gulf of Mexico.
	
	Based primarily on the island of Tortuga off the coast 
	of Haiti and in the city of Port Royal on the island of 
	Jamaica, the original Brethren were mostly French 
	Huguenot and British Protestants, but their ranks were 
	joined by other adventurers of various nationalities 
	including Spaniards, and even African sailors, as well 
	as escaped slaves and outlaws of various sovereigns.
	
	In keeping with their Protestant and mostly Common 
	Law heritage the Brethren were governed by codes of 
	conduct that favored legislative decision-making, 
	hierarchical command authority, individual rights, 
	and equitable division of revenues.

poseido*n
	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and

	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of

	they _fall in severe folds_; of Priestesses that they _float_;
	and of Wizards that they _swirl_.  You can thus see who you

	2.  For Kings.  The OMT here is _falling in stately folds_.

rock
	Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something.
	He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot
	with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were
	many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little
	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise
	throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and
	even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they
	saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of
	his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand,
	bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and
	throwing sort - indeed he could do lots of things, besides
	blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I
	haven't time to tell you about.  There is no time now.  While
	he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and
	soon he would have been dead.  At that moment Bilbo threw.
	The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped
	senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs
	curled up.

rock mole
	A rock mole is a member of the rodent family.  They get their

	is still unknown how they convert some of these things into
	something of nutritional value.

	fields of Pesh, mountains of corpses surrounding a creature
	whose body wavers between forms arachnid and lupine. Miska
	the Wolf-Spyder.
	
	The wind dukes and their servants (slaves?) are falling, the 
	former comets being doused and the latter as if a wind put 
	darkens a field of candles. One duke is a pillar for the the 
	forces of Law and its allies, shining in its gorgeous 
	androgyne nudity despite the vastness of Miska's shadow which 
	flows through forms like quicksilver. In his hand is a simple 
	black rod, elegant in its minimalism as befitting the nature 
	of its orderly creators. 
	
	The duke moves toward Miska, attendants falling around him as 
	sacrificial fodder for the historical moment.  A mountainous 
	black wolf with golden pupiless orbs has eight bebillith legs 
	that slash through the surrounding enemy. Then it is a silver 
	haired spider with eight lupine eyes and slavering jaws 
	between fangs should be, biting through stone giants and 
	lawful titans whose race ends here.
	
	What happens next is unclear - those who might have recalled 
	these moments better are lost even to the great powers shining 
	their light on this ancient past. One of the wind dukes that 
	was there before the tide of the demonic horde fell upon them 
	is dead, his body torn by gaping but perfectly circular holes. 
	One of the Vaati has speared the body of the Miska the

	pouring out light that strangely resembles rotted gold.

	Rust monsters are subterranean creatures with an appetite for
	all sorts of metals. These unique creatures, though generally
	inoffensive, are the bane of fighters everywhere. 
	The average rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high
	at the shoulder. It has a strange tail that appears armor plated
	and ends in an odd-looking bony projection that resembles a 
	double-ended paddle. Two prehensile antennae are located under
	the thing's two eyes. The hide of the rust monster is rough,
	covered with lumpy projections. Coloration varies from a 
	yellowish tan on the underside and legs, to a rust red upper
	back. Rust monsters smell like wet, oxidized metal.

sandestin
	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.
	
	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep
	in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
		[...]
	"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this
	was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"
	
	"And my indenture point?"
	
	"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"
	
	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."
	
	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"
	
	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at
	the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance,
	though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put

sasquatch
	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

shopkeeper
	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are generically
	known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear. Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark 
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets. And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale, the
	wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-volume
	novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in 
	common. They explain the observed facts, and they are completely
	and utterly wrong.

	"He can smell the devils before we can see them." ...
	Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the
	bushes.  They were violently shaken and then the dog slunk
	back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson. ...  "He was a man,"
	said Conan.  "I drink to his shade, and to the shade of the
	dog, who knew no fear."  He quaffed part of the wine, then
	emptied the rest upon the floor, with a curious heathen

	Slime mold or slime fungus, organism usually classified with

	molds have complex life cycles with an animal-like motile

	immotile reproductive phase.  The motile phase, commonly
	found under rotting logs and damp leaves, consists of either
	solitary amoebalike cells or a brightly colored multinucleate
	mass of protoplasm called a plasmodium, which creeps about
	and feeds by amoeboid movement.

	when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
	was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one

	unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
	
	And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou

	Said to be the most beautiful of the soul-cutting swords,
	Sode no Shirayuki (Sleaves of White Snow) demands a graceful, 
	dance-like fighting style of its wielder. It's most powerful
	techniques are activated by moving the blade in a specific
	way while calling out the name of the technique. The first
	dance, White Moon, invokes a freezing circle that embraces
	both heaven and earth. The next dance, White Ripple, fires
	a beam of snow and ice. The last dance, White Sword, repairs
	any damage the blade has suffered, and temporarily boosts its

	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle in
	which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from above, and
	tries to put them in designated locations. Only one box may be pushed
	at a time, not two, and boxes cannot be pulled. As the puzzle would
	be extremely difficult to create physically, it is usually implemented
	as a video game.
	
	Sokoban was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was published

spell
	A spell is a consciously directed act of magic which may take
	almost any form, depending on the laws of magic in operation.
	Commonly there will be a spoken element, ranging from a simple 
	phrase or name to elaborately complex ritual incantations. 
	[...]  Hand-gestures or passes may be required -- called 
	the "somatic element" by the scientific magic investigators 
	in L. Sprague de Camp's and Fletcher Pratt's _Incomplete
	Enchanter_ series.
	Many spells exhaust the caster, like Gorice's arduous conjuration
	in _The Worm Ouroboros_ (1922) by E. R. Eddison.  Jack Vance's 
	_The Dying Earth_ (1950) has spells which must be painstakingly 
	impressed on the mind (whose capacity is finite), and when cast 
	are gone until re-learned.

spire
	"Long ago a silver queen emerged from the Hinterlands below, 
	having followed the path of the great pillar, Axis Mundi, 
	that extended deep into the earth. She had come to see the 
	top of this edifice, and perhaps learn who had built the 
	foundation of her underground realm. Yet when she emerged 
	with her eight children--four sons and four daughters--she 
	saw that the Spire extended far into the sky. Eight great 
	roads extended out from the monument to Mystery, veering and 
	branching into sixteen paths that crossed and diverted, 
	shifting like living streams.
	
	While her children stared off into the distance, the queen 
	herself looked up into the sky. In the distance she saw that 
	infinity might have an end, a height that might be ascended 
	to. Her children felt the same way about the roads that ran 
	to embrace the horizon. Together they realized they might 
	walk and climb and thereby measure the Wheel, squaring the 
	circle at last.
	
	To each son and each daughter was given a blade, to keep them 
	safe on their journeys. And so the children each picked a 
	road and began walking, choosing different forks and turns, 
	getting lost but always finding themselves once more. 
	Meanwhile, the silver queen began to climb. She was 
	determined to reach the top of the Spire, for it was there 
	that she might watch for her children as she waited for their 
	return."

	or seemed likely to fall from off the bridge.  Now and then
	they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen
	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his

	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but

	A soul-cutting sword that is advanced to Bankai (Final
	Release) typically gains the ability to project some large,
	flashy effect, or to manifest a massive creature to do battle
	for its master. Not so Zangetsu. Instead, its final form,
	Tensa Zangetsu (Heaven-chain Slaying Moon), focuses all its
	power into the form of a normal daito sword. The shear 
	intensity of the energies within this sword make the blade
	almost impervious to damage, allowing it to parry a wide 
	variety of effects. The blade can additionally create a
	protective field around its wielder in the form of a cloak
	or long coat. Tensa Zangetsu may also be invoked to fire a
	powerful energy blast known as a Getsuga Tenso (Heaven-
	Piercing Moon-Fang) which can cleave through enemies and
	obstructing terain alike. Finally, the compressed forces
	at play in Tensa Zangetsu greatly affect the wielder's 
	sense of time, allowing them to move and attack much faster 
	than they otherwise could. The immense pressures acting on 
	the blade, however, are far beyond what a mortal can endure.
	Any living creature that wields this sword will find their

*throne
	Methought I saw the footsteps of a throne
	Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud--
	Nor view of who might sit thereon allowed;
	But all the steps and ground about were strown
	With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
	Ever put on; a miserable crowd,
	Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,
	"Thou art our king,
	O Death! to thee we groan."
	Those steps I clomb; the mists before me gave
	Smooth way; and I beheld the face of one
	Sleeping alone within a mossy cave,
	With her face up to heaven; that seemed to have
	Pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone;
	A lovely Beauty in a summer grave!

	A worshipper of Kali, who practised _thuggee_, the strangling

	Less than thirty Cat tribes now survived, roaming the cargo
	decks on their hind legs in a desperate search for food.
	But the food had gone.
	The supplies were finished.
	Weak and ailing, they prayed at the supply hold's silver
	mountains: huge towering acres of metal rocks which, in their
	pagan way, the mutant Cats believed watched over them.
	Amid the wailing and the screeching one Cat stood up and held
	aloft the sacred icon.  The icon which had been passed down
	as holy, and one day would make its use known.
	It was a piece of V-shaped metal with a revolving handle on
	its head.
	He took down a silver rock from the silver mountain, while
	the other Cats cowered and screamed at the blasphemy.
	He placed the icon on the rim of the rock, and turned the
	handle.
	And the handle turned.
	And the rock opened.
	And inside the rock was Alphabetti spaghetti in tomato sauce.

	and the Cyclops, were banished to the nether world.  Their
	enraged mother eventually released the youngest titan,

	A powerful fire-type soul-cutting sword, Tobiume (Flying

	defense. 
	
	Tobiume takes the form of a three-branched-sword, it's two side
	branches making it strong defensively but awkward on the offense.
	Tobiume is a mage's sword, able to draw on the mystical energies
	of its wielder to launch fireballs without pause. Should the 
	wielder be forced into close combat, the branches can be used to 
	disarm weapon-wielding opponents. Should the wielder succeed in 
	overcoming an opponent in melee, Tobiume will launch their bodies 
	backwards much like one of its fireballs.

	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the

towel
	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say
	on the subject of towels.
	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
	practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as
	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

	The trapper is a creature which has evolved a chameleon-like
	ability to blend into the dungeon surroundings.  It captures

tripe
tripe ration
	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.

*troll
	The troll shambled closer.  He was perhaps eight feet tall,
	perhaps more.  His forward stoop, with arms dangling past
	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.
	He clambered back on his feet and grinned at them.  The
	waning faggot cast red light over his fangs.

*twin gear*spirit*
	The Clockwork Perfection of Mechanus is driven by great 
	gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run 
	smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits."
	These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves 
	into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even 
	crossbows. This dual crossbow is actually two gear spirits,
	and they seem to have willingly fled with from Mechanus.
	
    Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of 
	Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these 
	spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love 
	the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons 
	rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a 
	result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the 
	great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while 
	to sample the Planes beyond their own. Most likely, these 
	two spirits caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback 
	along with you, peppering any hostile creature they see 
	with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless 
	supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for 
	to reload unless you wish to fire special crossbow bolts. 
	
    The spirits occasionally make small clicking and rattling 
	noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their 
	conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely 
	discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.

	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"

tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.

	legs all end in great claws.
*unicorn
unicorn horn
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
	[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.
	"You hold your beer awfully well."

	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling

	his katana on a rack near the entrance. However, the wakizashi
	would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made a sidearm for
	the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a pistol). The samurai
	would have worn it from the time they awoke to the time they went
	to sleep. In earlier periods, and especially during times of civil
	wars, a tanto was worn in place of a wakizashi.

	'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.  I am
	Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.  You have no
	colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'
	He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice.
	'Saruman, your staff is broken.'  There was a crack, and the
	staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it
	fell down at Gandalf's feet.  'Go!' said Gandalf.  With a cry
	Saruman fell back and crawled away.

ward
	Apotropaic magic (from Greek apotrepein, to ward off : apo-, 
	away + trepein, to turn) is a type of magic intended to 
	"turn away" harm or evil influences, as in deflecting 
	misfortune or averting the evil eye. "Apotropaic" 
	observances may also be practiced out of vague superstition 
	or out of tradition, as in good luck charm (perhaps some 
	token on a charm bracelet), amulets, or gestures like 
	fingers crossed or knocking on wood.

	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
	come west of the Mountains!"
	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc
	that one fears."
	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."

	They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the

	great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in
	black.  On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his
	House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the
	sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the
	hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again
	and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer
	stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had
	finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream,
	while men of both armies scrambled in the swirling waters for
	rubies knocked free of his armor.

	'I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that
	my foot first touched the water,' said Frodo. 'What was that

	'I do not know,' answered Gandalf; 'but the arms were all

	driven out of dark waters under the mountains. There are 
	older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of

	Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it
	was pale-green and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had
	hold of Frodo's foot, and was dragging him into the water.
	Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.  The

water demon
	[ The monkey king ] walked along the bank, around the pond. He examined
	the footprints of the animals that had gone into the water, and saw
	that none came out again! So he realized this pond must be possessed
	by a water demon. He said to the 80,000 monkeys, "This pond is
	possessed by a water demon. Do not let anybody go into it."

	After a little while, the water demon saw that none of the
	monkeys went into the water to drink. So he rose out of the middle of
	the pond, taking the shape of a frightening monster. He had a big blue
	belly, a white face with bulging green eyes, and red claws and feet.
	He said, "Why are you just sitting around? Come into the pond and drink
	at once!"

	The monkey king said to the horrible monster, "Are you the water
	demon who owns this pond?" "Yes, I am," said he. "Do you eat whoever
	goes into the water?" asked the king. "Yes, I do," he answered,
	"including even birds. I eat them all. And when you are forced by your
	thirst to come into the pond and drink, I will enjoy eating you, the
	biggest monkey, most of all!" He grinned, and saliva dripped down his
	hairy chin.

	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto

	the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,

	She slips and floats along the air 
	Till all her subtile house is made

	Her home, her bed, her daily food 
	All from that hidden store she draws; 
	She fashions it and knows it good, 
	By instinct's strong and sacred laws. 

	No tenuous threads to weave her nest, 
	She seeks and gathers there or here; 
	But spins it from her faithful breast, 
	Renewing still, till leaves are sere. 

	Then, worn with toil, and tired of life, 
	In vain her shining traps are set. 
	Her frost hath hushed the insect strife 
	And gilded flies her charm forget. 

	But swinging in the snares she spun, 
	She sways to every winter wind: 
	Her joy, her toil, her errand done, 
	Her corse the sport of storms unkind.
